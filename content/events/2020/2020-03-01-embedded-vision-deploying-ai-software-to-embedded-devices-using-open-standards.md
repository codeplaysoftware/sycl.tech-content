The world of AI & HPC is dominated by closed, proprietary software models. To get high performance today, systems need
accelerators that have high levels of parallelism, but use closed programming models like CUDA.

How do we open this up? How do we make these models safe enough to drive a car? How do we get an industry to work
together with industry standards? Andrew and Codeplay have been working on these challenges for years.

This talk will show the huge progress made today (SYCL, SPIR-V, oneAPI) and where weâ€™re going next.
