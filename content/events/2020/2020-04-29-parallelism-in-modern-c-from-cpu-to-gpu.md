CppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the
C++ community for the community and so we invite you to present. The conference regular program consists of five days of
eight tracks of seventy-five minute* sessions.

“Parallelism in Modern C++: From CPU to GPU” is a two-day training course with programming exercises taught by Gordon
Brown and Michael Wong. It is offered at the Gaylord Rockies from 9AM to 5PM on Saturday and Sunday, September 21st and
22nd (immediately following the conference). Lunch is included.
