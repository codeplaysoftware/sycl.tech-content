The oneAPI Data Parallel C++ compiler (DPC++ compiler) is a part of Intelâ€™s oneAPI effort to bring C++ and open
standards based programming capabilities to expressing complex algorithms for the CPU and accelerators on a system. The
DPC++ compiler provides powerful features from the Khronos* SYCL programming interface with a set of extensions to
provide developers with the full power of the C++ language and extensions for SYCL to enable programming heterogeneous
systems. These new features allow developers to more easily coordinate the use of accelerators such as discrete GPUs and
FPGAs for their parallel C++ applications.

This tutorial will briefly cover the basics of the SYCL and the DPC++ language extensions before presenting deeper
coverage of using the language features for heterogeneous programming. Attendees can take part in hands-on exercises to
create a small example and evolve it from a host-only shared-memory implementation to a heterogeneous implementation
that runs on both the host and an accelerator.
