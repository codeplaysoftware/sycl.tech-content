The IDEAS Productivity project, in partnership with the DOE Computing Facilities of the ALCF, OLCF, and NERSC and the
DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) has resumed the webinar series on Best Practices for HPC Software Developers, which
we began in 2016.

As part of this series, we offer one-hour webinars on topics in scientific software development and high-performance
computing, approximately once a month. The May webinar is titled SYCL - Introduction and Best Practices, and will be
presented by Thomas Applencourt (Argonne National Laboratory). The webinar will take place on Wednesday, June 10, 2020
at 1:00 pm ET.
