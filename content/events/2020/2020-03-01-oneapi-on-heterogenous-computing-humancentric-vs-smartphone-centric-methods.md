oneAPI (https://www.oneapi.com/) is a unified programming model to optimize performance for a wide range of data-centric
workloads across varied architectures such as in CPU, GPU, FPGA and other accelerators. It includes the programming
language, Data Parallel C++ based on Industry standard SYCL (https://sycl.tech/) that, together, deliver parallel
programming productivity, and cross-architecture application performance while providing an alternative to single
architecture programming approaches.
