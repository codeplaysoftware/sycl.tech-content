Join us for the inaugural [oneAPI Developer Summit](https://www.oneapi.com/events/devcon2020/) focused on oneAPI and
Data Parallel C++ for accelerated computing across xPU architectures(CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other accelerators). In this
two-day virtual conference, you will hear from industry and academia speakers working on innovative cross-platform
architecture solutions developed on oneAPI.

Learn from fellow developers and connect with other innovators. Please join us, a self-sustained, vibrant community to
support each other using oneAPI and Data Parallel C++.
