"Khronos SYCL and oneAPI: Heterogeneous Programming with Modern C++ and Machine Learning" By Michael
Wong (http://wongmichael.com/about). For me personally, I have been dreaming of something like SYCL and oneAPI since I
was involved with OpenMP. Even back then, I had always wished there was one programming model that could be used to
serve both the HPC and the embedded spaceâ€”instead of multiple models. SYCL helps to satisfy that goal.
