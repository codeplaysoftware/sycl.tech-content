title: CIUK 2023 Tutorial - Run the same code on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs with SYCL
external_url: 'https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/CIUK-2023-Day-Zero.aspx'
---

This breakout session will explore SYCL for cross-platform computing with two hour long sections, the first introducing
SYCL and the second introducing SYCLomatic a source to source translation tool. There will be ample time for questions
and answers. There will be live demonstrations and attendees who wish play along will have access to a cloud computing
platform with all the necessary software setup and ready to go.

Attendees do not need to be experts in GPU programming, but a passing familiarity with modern C++ would help. By the end
of the session they will come away with an awareness of SYCL and itâ€™s uses and how to translate existing CUDA code.
