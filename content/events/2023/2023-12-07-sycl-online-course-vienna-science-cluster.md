Nowadays most HPC systems are heterogeneous and use accelerators. oneAPI is a standardized and portable programming
model adapted to heterogeneous computing. In this course, Intel's oneAPI implementation will be used, which supports two
portable methods of heterogeneous computing: C++ with SYCL and OpenMP for C, C++, and Fortran.

Join us at this training event lead by Intel oneAPI certified instructors. Learn how to accelerate your code while
avoiding vendor lock-in. Write your code once and use it anywhere.

This course is jointly organized by the VSC Research Center, TU Wien, EuroCC Austria, and EuroCC Czechia.
