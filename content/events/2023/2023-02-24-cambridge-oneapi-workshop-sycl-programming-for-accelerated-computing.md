title: 'Cambridge oneAPI Workshop: SYCL Programming for Accelerated Computing'
---

This introductory workshop provided for students and researchers the University of Cambridge explores the challenges of
programming for heterogeneous high performance systems.

In this hands-on training, learners will be guided by Intel-qualified Research Software Engineers from the Cambridge
Open Zettascale Lab and Research Computing Services at the University of Cambridge.

The workshop will explain how the oneAPI toolkit can solve the challenges of programming in a heterogeneous world. It
will help learners to use oneAPI to enable their research workflows.

The workshop will provide an introduction to the SYCL language and programming model. SYCL is an open standard,
cross-architecture and cross-vendor programming solution for heterogeneous, high-performance computing (HPC). It breaks
proprietary lock-in and gives programmers the freedom to choose the best accelerated technology for their project.
During this training, you will learn how to use the SYCL programming language to target different types of accelerator
devices (e.g. CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs).

The workshop will also include familiarisation on the use of Jupyter notebooks.

The workshop will be made up of demonstrations and practical activities. It will include a programming challenge towards
the end of the day.
