title: SC23 - SYCL Tutorial

---

SYCL is a programming model that lets developers support a wide variety of devices (CPUs, GPUs, and more) from a single
code base. Given the growing heterogeneity of processor roadmaps, moving to an open standard, platform-independent model
such as SYCL is essential for modern software developers. SYCL has the further advantage of supporting a single-source
style of programming from completely standard C++.In this tutorial, we will introduce SYCL and provide programmers with
a solid foundation they can build on to gain mastery of this language. The main benefit of using SYCL over other
heterogeneous programming models is the single programming language approach, which enables one to target multiple
devices using the same programming model, and therefore to have a cleaner, portable, and more readable code.This is a
hands-on tutorial. The real learning will happen as students write code. The format will be short presentations followed
by hands-on exercises. Hence, attendees will require their own laptop to perform the hands-on exercises.
