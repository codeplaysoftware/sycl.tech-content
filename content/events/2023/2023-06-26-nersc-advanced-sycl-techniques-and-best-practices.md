The SYCL programming model means heterogeneous programming using C++ is now more accessible than ever. SYCL uses modern
standard C++, and itâ€™s a programming model that lets developers support a wide variety of devices(CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and
more) from a single code base. The growing popularity of this programming model means that developers are eager to
understand how to use all the features of SYCL and how to achieve great performance for their code.

While the tutorial assumes existing knowledge and some experience with using SYCL to develop code for accelerators such
as GPUs, video recordings of more introductory SYCL trainings that may help prepare you for this training are available
on this [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOStYsTQ7AFkiIpPzuOBWo0jI).

Concepts covered in this training include strategies for optimizing code, managing data flow, how to use different
memory access patterns, understanding work group sizes, using vectorization, the importance of ND ranges, and making the
most of the multiple devices available on your architecture.
