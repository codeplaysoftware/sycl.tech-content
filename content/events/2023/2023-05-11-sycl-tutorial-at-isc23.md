Parallel programming can be used to take advantage of heterogeneous architectures including GPUs, FPGAs, XPUs, IPUs,
TPUs or special units on CPUs to significantly increase the performance of applications. SYCL is an open standard
programming model that is defined by the industry and lets developers support many of these processors from different
vendors using a single code base and only modern standard C++ code. This tutorial will give software developers the
knowledge they need to begin developing parallel applications using C++ and the SYCL programming model. Our goal is to
equip attendees with the skills they need to build highly performant applications that can be used in the fields of HPC
and AI and deployed to multiple hardware platforms. We will cover the fundamentals of the SYCL programming model before
moving to more advanced topics. We will explore how SYCL can be used to write serious applications, covering
intermediate to advanced features of SYCL as well as some of the tools and libraries that support SYCL application
development.

This is a hands-on tutorial, attendees will work through exercises that represent key design patterns encountered by
people who program heterogeneous systems and deploy this code to multiple processors from different vendors.
