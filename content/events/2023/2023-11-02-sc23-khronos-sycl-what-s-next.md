The SYCL programming model provides an open standard way to program heterogeneous systems in modern C++. Since the major
SYCL2020 release, which added abstractions and features for HPC, SYCL has seen increased use in application domains
needing large exascale-class machines, including fusion energy, molecular dynamics, and aerospace. In this Birds of a
Feather session, we will bring together the community of everyone using and developing SYCL applications and
implementations. We will discuss future directions and seek feedback on priorities for SYCLNext. A panel of SYCL
experts, runtime/compiler implementers, and application specialists will lead an audience discussion and Q&A.
