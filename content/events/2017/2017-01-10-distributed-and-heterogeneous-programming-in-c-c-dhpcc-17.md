title: Distributed and Heterogeneous Programming in C/C++ (DHPCC++17)

In response to the demand for heterogeneous programming models for C/C++, and the interest in driving these models in
ISO C++, the SYCL Workshop has been morphed into Distributed & Heterogeneous Programming in C/C++ to include all the
programming models that have been designed to support heterogeneous programming in C and C++.

SYCL is a new Khronos specification for heterogeneous computing built on top of OpenCL and C++. The SYCL 1.2
specification was published on May 2015, and the current SYCL 2.2 specification has been published on February 2016.
Behind these two specifications, there has been an important community effort ongoing for more than five years. Now with
the specifications available and with Codeplay releasing
their [ComputeCpp Community Edition](https://www.codeplay.com/products/computesuite/computecpp).

But many other models now exist including HPX, KoKKos, Raja, C++AMP, HCC, Boost.Compute, and CUDA to name a few. This
conference aims to address the needs of both HPC and the consumer/embedded community where a number of C++ parallel
programming frameworks have been developed to address the needs of multi-threaded and distributed applications. The
C++11/14/17 International Standards have introduced new tools for parallel programming to the language, and the ongoing
standardization effort is developing additional features which will enable support for heterogeneous and distributed
parallelism into ISO C++ 20/23. This conference is an ideal place to discuss research in this domain, consolidate usage
experience, and share new directions to support new hardware and memory models with the aim of passing that experience
to ISO C and C++.

This workshop is based on a set of successful tutorials and workshops in different conferences, such as the SYCL
tutorial at Stanford University during [IWOCL](http://www.iwocl.org/) and the first SYCL workshop
at [PPoPPâ€™16](http://conf.researchr.org/track/PPoPP-2016/SYCL-2016-papers) as well as
the [Berkeley Heterogeneous C++ Summit in 2016](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/berkeleycppsummit2016/home).

There is a separate workshop at SuperComputing that involves directive-based acceleration, Workshop on Accelerator
Programming Using Directives (WACCPD) and one at ISC (Workshop on Performance Portable Programming Models for
Accelerators) which covers many of the Performance Portability concerns of a broader set of models (P^3MA). In contrast
DHPCC++ will focus on the needs of C and C++ due to the need to drive for ISO Standardization.
