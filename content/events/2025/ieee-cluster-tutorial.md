title: 'Write highly parallel, vendor neutral applications using C++ and SYCL'

SYCL is an open standard from the Khronos Group and defines a programming model that lets
developers support a wide variety of devices (CPUs, GPUs, and more) from a single code base.
Given the growing heterogeneity of processor roadmaps in both HPC and AI, moving to an open standard,
platform-independent model such as SYCL is essential for modern software developers. SYCL
has the further advantage of supporting a single-source style of programming using completely
standard C++. In this tutorial, we will introduce SYCL and provide programmers with a solid
foundation they can build on to gain mastery of this language. The main benefit of using SYCL
over other heterogeneous programming models is the single programming language approach, which
enables one to target multiple devices using the same programming model, and therefore to have a
cleaner, portable, and more readable code. This is a hands-on tutorial. The real learning will
happen as students write code. The format will be short presentations followed by hands-on exercises. 
Hence, attendees will require their own laptop to perform the hands-on exercises.
