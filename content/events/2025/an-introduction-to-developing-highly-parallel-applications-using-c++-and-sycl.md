title: 'An introduction to developing highly parallel applications using C++ and SYCL'
external_url: 'https://www.hipeac.net/2025/barcelona/#/program/sessions/8191/'
---

In this tutorial, we will introduce SYCL and provide programmers with a solid foundation
they can build on to gain mastery of this language. The main benefit of using SYCL over
other heterogeneous programming models is the single programming language approach, 
which enables one to target multiple devices using the same programming model, and 
therefore to have a cleaner, portable, and more readable code.

This is a hands-on tutorial. The real learning will happen as attendees write code. 
The format will be short presentations followed by hands-on exercises. 
Hence, attendees will require their own laptop to perform the hands-on exercises.
