title: 'An introduction to developing highly parallel applications using C++ and SYCL'
external_url: 'https://isc-hpc.com/program/schedule/'
---

Parallel programming can be used to take advantage of heterogeneous architectures
including GPUs, FPGAs, XPUs, IPUs, TPUs or special units on CPUs to significantly
increase the performance of applications. SYCL is an open standard programming model
that is defined by the industry and lets developers support many of these processors from
different vendors using a single code base and only modern standard C++ code.

This tutorial will give software developers the knowledge they need to begin developing
parallel applications using C++ and the SYCL programming model. Our goal is to equip
attendees with the skills they need to build highly performant applications that can be used in
the fields of HPC and AI and deployed to multiple hardware platforms.
We will cover the fundamentals of the SYCL programming model before moving to more
advanced topics. We will explore how SYCL can be used to write serious applications,
covering intermediate to advanced features of SYCL as well as some of the tools and
libraries that support SYCL application development.

This is a hands-on tutorial, attendees will work through exercises that represent key design
patterns encountered by people who program heterogeneous systems and deploy this code
to multiple processors from different vendors.
