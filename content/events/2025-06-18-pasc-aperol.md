Join us for the third "Application Perspective on SYCL (APerOL)" minisymposium at PASC'25 in Brugg on June 18, 2025.
This session will explore the real-world experiences of scientific developers using SYCL to achieve performance portability in high-performance computing.
The event will feature talks from Peter Thoman on the Celerity runtime system, Abhishek Bagusetty on the NWChemEx computational chemistry code,
Markus Büttner on coastal ocean simulations, and Timothée David–Cléris on the Shamrock astrophysics framework.
Presenters will share best practices for developing maintainable, high-performance code, discuss their use of SYCL on various hardware accelerators
from Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD, and highlight how open standards foster a more collaborative and reproducible scientific ecosystem.
