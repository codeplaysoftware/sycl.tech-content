Join us at the 6th International Workshop on OpenCL for three days of talks and workshops aimed at furthering the
collaboration and knowledge sharing amongst the international community of high-performance computing specialist working
with OpenCL, SYCL, SPIR and Vulkan Compute.

The event provides a rich mix of hands-on tutorials, technical presentations, research papers, posters sessions, peer
networking and vendor discussions and also provides a formal channel for community feedback to the Khronos Group, the
industry body responsible for the standards.
