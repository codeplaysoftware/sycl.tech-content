title: Distributed and Heterogeneous Programming in C/C++ (DHPCC++18)

---

In response to the demand for heterogeneous programming models for C/C++, and the interest in driving these models in
ISO C++, Distributed & Heterogeneous Programming in C/C++ includes all the programming models that have been designed to
support heterogeneous programming in C and C++.

Many models now exist including SYCL, HPX, KoKKos, Raja, C++AMP, HCC, Boost.Compute, and CUDA to name a few. This
conference aims to address the needs of both HPC and the consumer/embedded community where a number of C++ parallel
programming frameworks have been developed to address the needs of multi-threaded and distributed applications. The
C++11/14/17 International Standards have introduced new tools for parallel programming to the language, and the ongoing
standardization effort is developing additional features which will enable support for heterogeneous and distributed
parallelism into ISO C++ 20/23. This conference is an ideal place to discuss research in this domain, consolidate usage
experience, and share new directions to support new hardware and memory models with the aim of passing that experience
to ISO C and C++.
