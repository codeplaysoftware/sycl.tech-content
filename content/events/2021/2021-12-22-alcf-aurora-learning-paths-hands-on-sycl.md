The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) in partnership with Intel will host
a [hands-on learning series](https://events.cels.anl.gov/event/183/) that will explore the use of oneAPI and Data
Parallel C++ (DPC++), Intel's open-source implementation of SYCL, to demonstrate methods to achieve performant, portable
code across five different platforms available on the Intel Devcloud.
