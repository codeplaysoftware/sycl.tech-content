Join us for the first 2021 oneAPI Developer Summit in China focused on oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ for accelerated
computing across xPU architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other accelerators). In this one-day virtual conference, you
will hear from leading industry and academia speakers working on innovative cross-platform, multi-vendor architecture
oneAPI solutions. Learn more on oneAPI latest information and connect with other innovators. Dive into hands-on session
where you will learn and apply optimizations in order to fully exploit device capabilities on CPU’s and GPU’s/

Please join us, a self-sustained, vibrant community to support each other using oneAPI and Data Parallel C++.
