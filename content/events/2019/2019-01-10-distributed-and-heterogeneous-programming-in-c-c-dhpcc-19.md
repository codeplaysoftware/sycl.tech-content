title: Distributed and Heterogeneous Programming in C/C++ (DHPCC++19)
---

This will be the 3rd DHPCC++ event in partnership with IWOCL, the international OpenCL workshop with a focus on
heterogeneous programming models for C and C++, covering all the programming models that have been designed to support
heterogeneous programming in C and C++.

Many C++ programming models exist including SYCL, HPX, KoKKos, Raja, C++AMP, HCC, Boost.Compute, and CUDA. This
conference aims to address the needs of both HPC and the consumer/embedded community where a number of C++ parallel
programming frameworks have been developed to address the needs of multi-threaded and distributed applications. The
C++11/14/17 International Standards have introduced new tools for parallel programming to the language, and the ongoing
standardization effort is developing additional features which will enable support for heterogeneous and distributed
parallelism into ISO C++ 20/23. This conference is an ideal place to discuss research in this domain, consolidate usage
experience, and share new directions to support new hardware and memory models with the aim of passing that experience
to ISO C and C++.

## Call for Papers

You can submit your proposals for papers to the IWOCL [Easychair page]( https://www.iwocl.org/opencl-call-for-papers/)
using the DHPCC++ check box.

## Registration

Distributed & Heterogeneous Programming for C/C++ (DHPCC++) will take place on the workshop track of
the [International Workshop on OpenCL (IWOCL 19)](http://www.iwocl.org/). IWOCL 2019 will be held in Boston, USA, on May
13-15, 2019.

Registration for DHPCC++’19 will be completed on the IWOCL 2019 Conference [website](http://www.iwocl.org/), last year
there were more than 40 attendees.

## Important Dates

* Call For Papers closes end of Sunday January 27, 2019. 23:59 (AOE)

## Topics of Interest

**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:**

* Future Heterogeneous programming C/C++ proposals (SYCL, Kokkos, Raja, HPX, C++AMP, Boost.Compute, CUDA …)
* ISO C/C++ related proposals and development including current related concurrency, parallelism, coroutines, executors
* C/C++ programming models for OpenCL
* Language Design Topics such as parallelism model, data model, data movement, memory layout, target platforms, static
  and dynamic compilation
* Applications implemented using these models including Neural Network, machine vision, HPC, CFD as well as exascale
  applications
* C/C++ Libraries using these models
* Integration of these models with other programming models
* Compilation techniques to optimize kernels using any of (clang, gcc, ..) or other compilation systems
* Performance or functional comparisons between any of these programming models
* Implementation of these models on novel architectures (FPGA, DSP, …) such as clusters, NUMA and PGAS
* Using these models in fault-tolerant systems
* Porting applications from one model to the other
* Reports on implementations
* Research on Performance Portability
* Debuggers, profilers and other tools
* Usage in a Safety security context
* Applications implemented using similar models
