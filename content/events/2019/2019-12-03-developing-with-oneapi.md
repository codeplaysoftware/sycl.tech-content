If you are a programmer who wants to build and run a compute-intensive, data-centric application or workload, such as
HPC, AI, data analytics and more, across multiple architectures including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and other accelerators, you
know what a nightmare it is to learn all the different programming models and make them work together even before you
start optimizing anything. oneAPI, whose backbone is Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) based on C++ and SYCL, makes
cross-architecture development an easier task.
