Heterogeneous computing is now the norm for systems ranging from low-end embedded devices up to the high-end HPC systems
to reach high-performance while keeping power consumption low.

Programming multi-processor system-on-chips with different kinds of processors, graphics processing units (GPU),
configurable specific accelerators (video CoDec, machine-learning accelerators...), reconfigurable programmable logic (
FPGA), coarse-grain reconfigurable arrays (CGRA), various hierarchies of memory and memory interfaces, configurable I/O
and network support, security support, power control, etc. is a real challenge.

This presentation covers the SYCL programming standard from the Khronos Group (http://sycl.tech) which aims to solve
some of these programming issues.

Speaker: Ronan Keryell, Principal Software Engineer, Xilinx Research Labs
