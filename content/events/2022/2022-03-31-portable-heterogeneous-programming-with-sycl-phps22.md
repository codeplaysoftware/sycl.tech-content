---

The PHPS22 workshop is co-located with [ISC22 in Hamburg, Germany](https://www.isc-hpc.com/workshops-2022.html). To
attend you must [register for a workshop pass at ISC](https://www.isc-hpc.com/).

This workshop aims to focus on the experience of programming the current and next generation heterogeneous systems. It
aims to be a platform for HPC/AI code developers, users, and providers of systems and tools to come together and share
their experiences, successes, and challenges when using the Khronos open standard SYCLâ„¢ interface for programming
heterogeneous systems. The workshop will feature a mix of peer-reviewed talks, lightning talks, and an invited keynote
talk. In this full-day workshop attendees of the "Portable Heterogeneous Programming with SYCL" workshop will share
their work to create a deeper understanding of vendor-neutral high-performance heterogeneous programming through talks
and demonstrations using SYCL and related tools, plus interaction with academic and industry experts from Europe and
around the world.
