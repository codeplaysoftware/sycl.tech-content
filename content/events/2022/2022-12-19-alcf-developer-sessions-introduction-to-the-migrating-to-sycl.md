title: 'ALCF Developer Sessions: Introduction to the Migrating to SYCL'
external_url: 'https://events.cels.anl.gov/event/385/overview'
---

SYCL is becoming a de facto standard for vendor agnostic heterogeneous computing. Upgrading CUDA code to standard C++
with SYCL makes the applications portable across a range of existing and evolving accelerators including NVidia GPUs.
The"Migrating to SYCL" portal on Intel Developer Zone is designed to help the worldwide developer community successfully
port their applications to oneAPI, helping developers break free from propriety APIs and provide greater customer choice
in hardware for performance, power usage and cost.
