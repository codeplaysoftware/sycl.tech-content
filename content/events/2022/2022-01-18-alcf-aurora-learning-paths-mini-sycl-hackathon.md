The Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) in partnership with Intel will host a hands-on learning series that
will explore the use of oneAPI and Data Parallel C++(DPC++), Intel's open-source implementation of SYCL, to demonstrate
methods to achieve performant, portable code across five different platforms available on the Intel Devcloud.
