Join us for this yearâ€™s oneAPI Developer Summit at IWOCL focused on oneAPI and SYCL for accelerated computing across xPU
architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other accelerators). In this one-day virtual conference, you will hear from industry
and academia speakers working on innovative cross-platform, multi-vendor architecture solutions developed on oneAPI.
Learn from fellow developers and connect with other innovators. Please join us, a self-sustained, vibrant community to
support each other using oneAPI, SYCL and Data Parallel C++.
