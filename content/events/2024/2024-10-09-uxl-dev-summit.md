Join us for an in-depth showcase of oneAPI specification along with open-source
projects that implement oneAPI specification. oneAPI is designed to enable developers
to use a single code base across multiple accelerators and architectures, supporting
artificial intelligence, high performance computing, edge computing, automotive, and more.
 
Hosted by the UXL Foundation, this community-led conference brings together developers to
explore, share, and showcase the capabilities of oneAPI through hands-on tutorials, demos,
technical talks, and panel discussions.
 
We welcome you for two days across global time zones to discover how oneAPI is being used today
and explore its future. Join our ever-growing community.
