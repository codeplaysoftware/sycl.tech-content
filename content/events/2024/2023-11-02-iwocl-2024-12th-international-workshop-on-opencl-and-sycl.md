IWOCL 2024 marks the 12th anniversary of the annual gathering of the international community of OpenCL and SYCL
developers, researchers, implementers, scientists and Khronos Working Group members to share best practice, and to
advance the use and evolution of these Khronos open compute languages for programming heterogeneous platforms.

This pioneering workshop has been attracting an international audience of leading academic and industrial experts since
2013 and is the premier forum for the community to present, discuss and learn about applying SYCL and OpenCL to solve
computationally-demanding problems across a wide range of application domains.
