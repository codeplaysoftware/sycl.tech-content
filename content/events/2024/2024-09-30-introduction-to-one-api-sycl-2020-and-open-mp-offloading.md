Most current HPC systems are heterogeneous and use accelerators. oneAPI is a standardized and portable programming model
adapted to heterogeneous computing. In this course we will provide an introduction to Intel's oneAPI implementation,
which supports two portable methods of heterogeneous computing: Data Parallel C++ (DPC) with SYCL and OpenMP for C, C++,
and Fortran. Both are portable on any Intel CPU and Intel based accelerator, but also other GPUs. The course will give
an introduction in these two programming methods, Intel's libraries like oneMKL and tools for performance analysis,
profiling, and debugging. Further an introduction to Intel's DPC compatibility Tool to facilitate code migration from
CUDA to SYCL and to Intel's MPI implementation support with GPU awareness completes the program.
