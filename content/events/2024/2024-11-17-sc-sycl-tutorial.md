SYCL is a programming model that lets developers support a wide variety of devices (CPUs, GPUs, and more)
from a single-code base. Given the growing heterogeneity of processor roadmaps, moving to an open standard, 
platform-independent model such as SYCL is essential for modern software developers. SYCL has the further 
advantage of supporting a single-source style of programming using completely standard C++.

In this tutorial, we will introduce SYCL and provide programmers with a solid foundation they can build on
to gain mastery of this language. The main benefit of using SYCL over other heterogeneous programming models
is the single programming language approach, which enables one to target multiple devices using the same programming model,
and therefore to have a cleaner, portable, and more readable code.

This is a hands-on tutorial. The real learning will happen as students write code. The format will be short presentations
followed by hands-on exercises. Hence, attendees will require their own laptop to perform the hands-on exercises.
