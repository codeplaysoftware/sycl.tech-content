Portable SYCL code using oneMKL on AMD, Intel, and Nvidia GPUs, presented by CodePlay and Intel, is part of the
Performance Portability training series. This series, offered by OLCF, NERSC, and ALCF, features training sessions on
various performance portable programming solutions to help ease developer transitions between current and emerging
high-performance computing (HPC) systems, such as the NERSC Perlmutter, OLCF Frontier, and ALCF Aurora featuring
NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel-based GPUs, respectively.
