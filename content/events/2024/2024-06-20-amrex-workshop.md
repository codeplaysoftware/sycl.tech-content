Organised by the In-situ visualization and unified programming across accelerator architectures at exascale H&ES
ExCALIBUR project, and hosted by the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, the AMReX at
Exascale workshop will be running between Monday 24th and Tuesday 25th of June. There will be one day focused on open
source programming on accelerated devices and another on AMReX and AMR methods in general.

As a part of the ExCALIBUR ECP exchange programme, we have invited several speakers who are prominently involved in
exascale programs running on Aurora and Frontier. Talks also include experts from other ExCALIBUR projects, and range
from porting CUDA codes to SYCL, to exascale AMR and N-body codes using GPUs, to achieving performance portability with
Kokkos, as well as running visualizations at scale on Aurora.
