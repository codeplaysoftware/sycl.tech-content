In this webinar attendees will learn the fundamentals of the SYCL programming model, exploring its key concepts and
capabilities, and how to leverage oneAPI tools to bridge SYCL code with proprietary programming models such as CUDA and
HIP, and deploy on a variety of hardware platforms.

The webinar also features a detailed example of a successful CUDA to SYCL migration, showcasing the practical steps and
benefits of this approach. With ample time for questions and discussion, attendees will leave with a solid understanding
of SYCL and the confidence to apply it to their own HPC projects.

Finally, the webinar also introduces developers to the SYCL oneAPI Hackaton at CINECA, a three-stage event (this
webinar, an online learning course, and a final on-site Hackaton) where attendees will learn how to effectively write
efficient heterogeneous SYCL code, and how to use oneAPI tools to deploy it on CINECA’s Leonardo, a Tier-0 EuroHPC
supercomputer ranked #7 on the Top500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.
