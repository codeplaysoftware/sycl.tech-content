The SYCL Hackathon @ CINECA is a multi-day, in-person event designed to help developer teams to port and/or
optimize their codes for GPUs using the SYCL programming model. During the event developers will have the 
chance to work alongside mentors and SYCL programming experts, which will guide them in porting and optimizing their code.

SYCL is an open-standard, cross-platform heterogeneous programming model that allows developers
to write code in standard modern C++, while at the same time enabling them to reuse their code 
on a huge variety of hardware accelerator targets (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs).

Participants will also have to opportunity of using Leonardo, one of the most powerful 
computers in the world (https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/).
