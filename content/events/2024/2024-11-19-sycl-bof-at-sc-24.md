title: 'SYCL BoF @ SC 24 | Khronos SYCL: Heterogeneous Programming with Open Standards'
external_url: 'https://sc24.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=bof174&sess=sess631'

The open-standard SYCL programming model provides a portable way to program heterogeneous systems.
The abstractions and features for HPC in SYCL has seen its increased use in application domains needing
GPU-accelerated Top500 machines such as Aurora and Dawn, for fusion energy, molecular dynamics, aerospace and AI.

In this session, we will bring together the community of everyone using and developing SYCL applications
and implementations. We will discuss future directions and seek feedback on priorities for the next
version of SYCL. A panel of SYCL experts, runtime/compiler implementers, and application specialists 
will lead an audience discussion and Q&A.
