The SYCL specification has been updated to SYCL v1.2.1 revision 3 providing a maintenance update to the published
specification. This new revision of the SYCL specification introduces clarifications and enhancements to improve
consistency. These changes, agreed by the SYCL working group, will make it easier to learn SYCL and write generic code.
