Following Peter Bauer’s blog on scalability in this series on high-performance computing (HPC), here I discuss the
emerging challenge of greater diversity in computer architectures – set to be another key topic at ECMWF’s HPC Workshop
in September.

In the past decade we have been used to the dominance of a single vendor in HPC processors: Intel. With their now
ubiquitous x86 architecture, Intel processors currently power 95% of the systems in the June 2018 Top500 list. However,
2018 has seen the emergence of viable alternatives to this status quo.
