The Khronos™ Group announces the availability of the SYCL™ Adopters Program for the C++-based programming framework for
parallel programming. Under the Adopters Program, implementers of SYCL 1.2.1 can access an extensive conformance test
suite, and then upload their test results to Khronos for review and the opportunity to become officially conformant.
