After Imagination first announced their PowerVR Series2NX Neural Network Accelerator (NNA) last September, it has become
a key part in their ambitions for AI and neural networks on the edge, with smaller devices intended for inferencing. So
along with their new Series9X-P GPUs, Imagination is taking the next major step in their neural networking journey,
announcing the PowerVR Series3NX Neural Network Accelerator (NNA) and its family of IP cores, as well as a programmable
3NX-F IP configuration containing a 3NX NNA, Rogue GPGPU, and local memory which includes support for SYCL.
