Ayesha Afzal and Christian Schmitt are based at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t and part of a team working on the "
HighPerMeshes" research project, a collaborative research project funded by German Ministry of Education and Research 
(BMBF).

The project team decided to use SYCL to develop the code for their research because it allowed them to write modern C++
code that can be deployed to a range of heterogeneous hardware.

Christian has written the following post about their project and how the team used SYCL to make it a success.
