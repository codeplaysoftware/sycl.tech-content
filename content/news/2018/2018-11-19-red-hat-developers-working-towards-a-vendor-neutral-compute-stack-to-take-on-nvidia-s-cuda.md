Longtime open-source graphics driver contributor and DRM subsystem maintainer, David Airlie of Red Hat, presented at
this week's Linux Plumbers Conference on such a compute stack. "Until now the clear market leader has been the CUDA
stack from NVIDIA, which is a closed source solution that runs on Linux. Open source applications like tensorflow (
AI/ML) rely on this closed stack to utilise GPUs for acceleration...This talk will discuss the possibility of creating a
vendor neutral reference compute stack based around open source technologies and open source development models that
could execute compute tasks across multiple vendor GPUs. Using SYCL/OpenCL/Vulkan and the open-source Mesa stack, as the
basis for a future task that development of tools and features on top of as part of a desktop OS."
