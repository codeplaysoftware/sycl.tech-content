8 leading European organisations join forces to bring together RISC-V and SYCL standards to demonstrate ground-breaking
advances in scalability of extreme data analytics via fully-open AI acceleration

The wide-spread adoption of AI has resulted in a market for novel hardware accelerators that can efficiently process AI
workloads. Unfortunately, all popular AI accelerators today use proprietary hardware—software stacks, leading to a
monopolization of the acceleration market by a few large industry players.

Eight leading European organizations have joined in an effort to break this monopoly via Horizon Europe project
SYCLOPS (Scaling extreme analytics with Cross-architecture acceleration based on Open Standards). **The vision of
SYCLOPS is to democratize AI acceleration using open standards, and enabling a healthy, competitive, innovation-driven
ecosystem for Europe and beyond**. This vision relies on the convergence of two important trends in the industry: (i)
the standardization and adoption of RISC-V®, a free, open Instruction Set Architecture(ISA), for AI and analytics
acceleration, and (ii) the emergence and growth of SYCL™ as a cross-vendor, cross-architecture, data parallel
programming model for all types of accelerators, including RISC-V.
