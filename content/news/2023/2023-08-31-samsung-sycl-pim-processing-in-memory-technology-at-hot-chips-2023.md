At Hot Chips 2023 (35) Samsung is talking about its processing-in-memory(PIM) again with new research and a new twist.
We have covered this previously, for example in our Hot Chips
33 [Samsung HBM2-PIM and Aquabolt-XL](https://www.servethehome.com/samsung-hbm2-pim-and-aquabolt-xl-at-hot-chips-33/).
Now, Samsung is showing this in the context of AI.

PIM has been made programmable using SYCL through the SYCL-PIM implementation work.
