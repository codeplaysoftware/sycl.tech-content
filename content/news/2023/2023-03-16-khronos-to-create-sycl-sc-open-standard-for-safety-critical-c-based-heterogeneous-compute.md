New Working Group designing derivative of the SYCL framework for high-level parallel programming to streamline safety
certification in automotive, avionics, industrial, and medical markets; Open call for industry participation.

Today, The Khronos® Group, an open consortium of industry-leading companies creating advanced interoperability
standards, announces the creation of the [SYCL™ SC Working Group](https://www.khronos.org/syclsc)to create a high-level
heterogeneous computing framework for streamlining certification of safety-critical systems in automotive, avionics,
medical, and industrial markets. SYCL SC will leverage the proven SYCL 2020 standard for parallel programming of diverse
computing devices using standard C++17. Over the past year, the safety-critical community has gathered in the Khronos
SYCL Safety-Critical Exploratory Forum to build consensus on use cases and industry requirements to catalyze and guide
the design of this new open standard. The SYCL SC Working Group is open to any Khronos member, and Khronos membership is
open to any company.
