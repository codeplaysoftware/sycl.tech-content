The past few years there has been hipSYCL as an open-source project for not only taking SYCL codes to Radeon ROCm with
HIP but also NVIDIA CUDA and other targets. The hipSYCL project has now decided to rename itself to Open SYCL to reflect
its broader focus on supporting CPUs and GPUs from all major vendors and not being limited to just AMD's HIP interface.
