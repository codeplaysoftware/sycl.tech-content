Enabling interoperability across U.S. exascale supercomputers is one of the chief goals for the U.S. Exascale Computing
Project ([ECP](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)), which has broadly overseen development of the early software
ecosystem needed to support the new class of supercomputers. Earlier this month, ECP held its annual
community [BOF days](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/2023-ecp-community-bof-days/#sycl-state-of-the-union), a
virtual event spanning a wide range of topics â€“ including a session on SYCL, which has been gaining momentum as a
programming framework for heterogeneous computing.
