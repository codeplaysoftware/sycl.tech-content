Exascale Computing Project at the University of Cambridge uses Khronos SYCL Standard to Develop Performance Portable
FEniCS Libraries for the Finite Element Method.

Researchers from the University of Cambridge use SYCL™ as a high-performance language for solving differential equations
with the finite element method. SYCL is an open, non-proprietary, royalty-free programming language developed and
maintained by the Khronos® Group open standards consortium, with multiple compiler implementations that enable
performance portable code on new-generation and multi-vendor hardware.
