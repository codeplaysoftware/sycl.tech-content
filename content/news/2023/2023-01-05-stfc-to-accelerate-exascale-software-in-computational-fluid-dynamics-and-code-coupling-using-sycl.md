title: STFC to Accelerate Exascale Software in Computational Fluid Dynamics and Code Coupling using SYCL
---

The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Scientific Computing Department (SCD) has established a new oneAPI
Centre of Excellence in collaboration
with Intel.

This will accelerate exascale software development on multi-architecture systems using the Khronos SYCL standard and the
oneAPI open, cross-architecture programming model. A team of computational scientists within SCD will lead and develop
the Centre and its activities.

The new Centre, which will be based at STFC's Daresbury Laboratory, will focus on optimising two prominent open source
HPC software codes: a C++ coupling library called the Multiscale Universal Interface (MUI); and a high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics code called Xcompact3d. Both are integral within the UK's ExCALIBUR exascale programme and
are part of its landscape for developing future exascale computing capabilities, providing accelerated computing
platforms able to handle upwards of a trillion of calculations per second.
