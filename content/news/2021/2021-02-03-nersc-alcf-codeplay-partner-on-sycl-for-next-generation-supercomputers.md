The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley
Lab), in collaboration with the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF)at Argonne National Laboratory, has signed a
contract with Codeplay Software to enhance the LLVM SYCL™ GPU compiler capabilities for NVIDIA® A100 GPUs.

This collaboration will help NERSC and ALCF users, along with the high-performance computing community in general,
produce high-performance applications that are portable across compute architectures from multiple vendors.

Codeplay is a software company based in the U.K. that has a long history of developing compilers and tools for different
hardware architectures. The company has been the lead implementor of SYCL compilers and a main contributor to the
existing open source support for NVIDIA V100 GPUs through the DPC++ project. NVIDIA A100 GPUs are available in the
ThetaGPU extension of ALCF’s Theta and will power NERSC’s next-generation supercomputer, Perlmutter.
