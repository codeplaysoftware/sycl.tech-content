Ginkgo is a production-ready, sparse linear algebra library used for HPC on GPU architectures. It’s now using oneAPI
cross-architecture programming to support its foundational design with a high level of performance portability, and
focus on software sustainability. ExpertsHartwig Anzt at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and Univ. of Tennessee,
and Terry Cojean of KIT provide their insights on lessons learned moving CUDA code to other hardware architectures, and
tools that help smooth that transition. “…The oneAPI ecosystem has proven to be a very powerful and useful option for us
to actually target different architectures that are all supported by oneAPI…”
