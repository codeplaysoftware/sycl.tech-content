As part of a series aimed at sharing best practices in preparing applications for Aurora, we highlight researchers’
efforts to optimize codes to run efficiently on graphics processing units.

"Moreover, without making any changes to their code, the team will be able to take advantage of the upcoming SYCL/DPC++
implementation of Kokkos—which is expected to be highly performant and broadly portable across architectures—immediately
at the time of its release."
