The [SuperComputing Conference (SC21)](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/) is the largest gathering of HPC professionals
in the world and this year is being held as a hybrid event with both online and in person activities happening. One of
the benefits I have found from online events is that it's possible to bring together a much wider group of experts with
specific competencies. The SYCL tutorials that I have organized this year have been able to feature individuals from a
wide range of organizations which just would not be possible if these were held physically.

This year there are lots of sessions that are highly relevant for SYCL developers and the wider community
