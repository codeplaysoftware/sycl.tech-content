In the first of a series of guest posts on heterogenous computing, James Reinders, considers how SYCL will contribute to
a heterogeneous future for C++.

“SYCL is not a cure-all; SYCL is a solution to one aspect of a larger problem: how do we enable programming in the face
of an explosion of hardware diversity that is coming?”
