**In this[#xpublog](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23xpublog) post, I cover three things:**

- What is an XPU - and why should I care?
- What is SYCL?, and how can it be used to make our neurotic kitten lighten up (you won't want to miss that)
- How can I try it out for myself using the Intel DevCloud for oneAPI (all free, easy, and very cool)
