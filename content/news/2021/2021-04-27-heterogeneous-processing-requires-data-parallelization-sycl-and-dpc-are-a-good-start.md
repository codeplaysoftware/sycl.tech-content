The learnings from both CUDA and OpenCL set the stage for the emergence of a truly popular and open solution for data
parallelism based on C++ for heterogeneous systems. That solution is SYCL, which is a higher-level programming model to
improve programming productivity on multiple hardware accelerators. It has quickly gained broad multivendor support,
widespread interest and the support of multiple serious compiler projects.
