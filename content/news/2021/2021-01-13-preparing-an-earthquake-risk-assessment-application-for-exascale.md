As part of a new series aimed at sharing best practices in preparing applications for Aurora, we highlight researchers'
efforts to optimize codes to run efficiently on graphics processing units (GPUs).

So as to prepare for next-generation systems like Aurora, developers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne
National Laboratory are working to port the SW4 application—a multidisciplinary simulation code for earthquake hazard
and risk assessment—to run on GPU-based Intel machines. As part of the EQSIM project supported by DOE's Exascale
Computing Project, Brian Homerding of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) and Houjun Tang of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory are leading an effort to use the C++ abstraction library RAJA, whose SYCL backend is
currently being written.
