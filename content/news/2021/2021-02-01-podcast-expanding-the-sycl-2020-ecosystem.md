Open standards underpin the future of heterogeneous programming, and as Intel Principal Engineer Jeff Hammond points
out, SYCL has proven in many ways that "standards don’t cost you a thing, and you get portability." A modern C++
language, SYCL has demonstrated amazing growth and now boasts four implementations—ComputeCpp, triSYCL, hipSYCL and
DPC++. hipSYCL Creator Aksel Alpay explains some of the differences between these implementations, and how hipSYCL is
evolving to incorporate DPC++ features contributed to the SYCL 2020 specification, including unified shared memory (
USM), reductions, group algorithms and subgroups. The two also dive into a discussion of buffers and accessors, and
Aksel debunks a few myths around hipSYCL.
