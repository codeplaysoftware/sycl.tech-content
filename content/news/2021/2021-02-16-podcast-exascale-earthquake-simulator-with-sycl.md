We introduce the first in a special series based on an effort aimed at sharing best practices in preparing applications
for the upcoming Aurora exascale supercomputer at the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory. The
application uses RAJA as a framework to harness the acceleration of the supercomputer, and RAJA is being developed to
run on GPUs using DPC++. That is part of Intel’s oneAPI, and it’s an implementation of the SYCL programming model.
