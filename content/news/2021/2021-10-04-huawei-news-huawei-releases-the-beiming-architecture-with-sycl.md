Xiong Yan pointed out that the basic enabling software of Beiming architecture, that is, through Bisheng C++ programming
language, Bisheng compiler, and Beiming fusion acceleration library, provides versatile, efficient and high-performance
development capabilities for diverse computing systems.

Among them, Bisheng C++ supports the SYCL heterogeneous programming standard, and realizes a language to program
Kunpeng, Shengteng and mainstream computing power in the industry. Beiming Fusion Acceleration Library provides
API-based programming calls for key functions in the field, is compatible with mainstream application frameworks,
provides a unified API interface for multiple computing power, and supports AI + big data, HPC + AI, HPDA and other
fusion applications.
