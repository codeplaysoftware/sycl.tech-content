In 2020 we launched "SYCL Summer Sessions," an online event series designed to help you learn how to write better code
using SYCL. Last year we brought expert SYCL developers together to share their in depth knowledge of developing highly
parallel software. The videos from last year are online and available on demand and cover some great topics useful for
both experienced and new SYCL developers.

We have opened a call for presentations for the event this year which closes on July 23rd. All submissions will be
reviewed by prominent members of the SYCL developer community.
