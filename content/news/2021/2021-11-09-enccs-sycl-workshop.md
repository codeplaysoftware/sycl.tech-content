Welcome to this ENCCS workshop, in collaboration with [CSC Finland](https://www.csc.fi)
and [Izum, Slovenia](https://izum.si/en/home/).

SYCL is a C++ abstraction layer for programming heterogeneous hardware with a single-source approach. SYCL is
high-level, cross-platform, and extends standard ISO C++17. You will learn to:

* Use the hipSYCL compiler to generate executable for multiple hardware targets.
* Write hardware-agnostic code to express parallelism using the queue, command group, and kernel abstractions.
* Use buffer and accessors to handle memory across devices.
* Evaluate drawbacks and advantages of unified shared memory.
