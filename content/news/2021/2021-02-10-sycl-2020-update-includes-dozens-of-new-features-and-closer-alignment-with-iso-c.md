**Beaverton, OR – February 9, 2021 –** Today, [The Khronos® Group](https://www.khronos.org/), an open consortium of
industry-leading companies creating advanced interoperability standards, announces the ratification and public release
of the [SYCL™ 2020 final specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/)—the open standard for single source C++
parallel programming. A major milestone encompassing years of specification
development, [SYCL 2020](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/)builds on the functionality of SYCL 1.2.1 to provide
improved programmability, smaller code size and increased performance. Based on C++17, SYCL 2020 enables easier
acceleration of standard C++ applications and drives a closer alignment with the ISO C++ roadmap.
