In a world where AI, HPC and Safety-Critical acceleration is shifting toward heterogeneous architectures that
integrate processors with different architectures from multiple vendors, the need for seamless interoperability and
shared open standards has never been more critical. That's why the UXL Foundation (Unified Acceleration) and the
Khronos Group have entered into a liaison agreement to help accelerate the evolution of open accelerated
heterogeneous programming.

At the heart of the UXL-Khronos liaison is a mutual desire for cooperation and synergy to help foster the rapid
evolution of a vibrant and open ecosystem to support heterogeneous programming. Both organizations aim to align
their strengths, particularly in how SYCL from Khronos evolves to meet developer requirements and supporting
and complementing the UXL Foundation libraries, and open source projects—and vice versa.
