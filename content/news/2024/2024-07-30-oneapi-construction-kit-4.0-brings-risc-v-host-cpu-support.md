Last year the oneAPI Construction Kit was introduced by Intel-owned Codeplay Software 
for bringing SYCL to new hardware even for hardware outside of Intel's offerings. One 
of the early targets of this oneAPI Construction Kit support was for RISC-V processors 
and now with today's release of oneAPI Construction Kit 4.0 there is finally RISC-V host CPU support.
