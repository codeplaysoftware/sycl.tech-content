The India-based premier R&D organization used tools in the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit to free itself from vendor
hardware lock-in by migrating its open-source seismic modeling application from CUDA to SYCL. As a result, application
performance improved by 1.75x
on [Intel® Datacenter GPU Max 1550](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/232873/intel-data-center-gpu-max-1550/specifications.html)
when compared to NVIDIA A100 platform performance.
