Floods cause enormous damage each year, posing significant threats to people and infrastructure. Due to climate change,
we are seeing more frequent and severe flood events around the world. Hydrodynamic flood models are powerful tools to
help with reducing flood risks. They can simulate the behaviour of water flow and the extent of flooding during a flood
event. These models are essential for predicting floods and understanding flood risks, and ultimately help increase
societal resilience.
