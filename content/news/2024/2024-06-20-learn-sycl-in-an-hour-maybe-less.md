In this piece, I will introduce all the key things to know to program in C++ with SYCL.

I obviously will cover only the bare essentials; therefore, I'm not teaching everything that you would find in a 
500-page book on SYCL. If you tell me that surprises you, I will assume you are joking.

We will learn the basics (1-2-3) and have a small working program that we can use to explore more as we wish.
