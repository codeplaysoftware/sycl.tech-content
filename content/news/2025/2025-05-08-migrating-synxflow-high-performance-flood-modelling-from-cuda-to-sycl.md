The SynxFlow hydrodynamic modeling code was re-engineered using oneAPI, Intel’s implementation of SYCL,
a cross-vendor heterogeneous programming model. This transformation aimed to address limitations in GPU
compatibility and enhance scalability for next-generation Exa-Scale High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
The new implementation delivers improved performance, interoperability, and scalability across diverse hardware
platforms, enabling ground-breaking large-scale probabilistic forecasting with high spatial and temporal resolutions.  

The SYCL implementation and Performance tests used components of the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit
and Dawn, one of the UK’s newest and fastest artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers.
