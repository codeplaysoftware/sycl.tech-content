The Khronos® Group is celebrating a significant milestone as SYCL™ marks its tenth anniversary. First ratified and
published in May 2015, SYCL has grown from an ambitious specification to a cornerstone of heterogeneous computing,
enabling developers to write single-source C++ code for a wide range of accelerators, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and
specialized AI hardware.

The SYCL developer community and members of the Khronos SYCL Working Group recently gathered at the International
Workshop on OpenCL and SYCL (IWOCL 2025) to share the latest developments in the SYCL ecosystem, and celebrate this
milestone.
