CERN hosts the worldâ€™s largest particle accelerator, the LHC, where beams of particles
are accelerated and made to collide to study the fundamental structures of our universe.
The LHC produces petabytes of physics data regarding particle collisions that need to be
analysed efficiently. These collisions are expressed as operations on particles, represented
as 4-dimensional time-space vectors, also known as Lorentz Vectors. Analysing these
massive amounts of data naturally requires highly efficient and complex software solutions.
