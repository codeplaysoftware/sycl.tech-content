Imagination Technologies announces that developers working with TensorFlow will be able to target PowerVR GPUs directly
thanks to newly optimised open source SYCL neural network libraries. The first release will be available in
November 2019.

The SYCL version of TensorFlow supports a very large number of AI operations (see Graph 1) and is easily
user-customisable, meaning that developers using the latest neural networks, or researching their own AI technologies,
can run those networks out-of-the-box with high performance on PowerVR. Because TensorFlow SYCL support is both open
source and open standards-based, itâ€™s an ideal solution for developers who want to accelerate the latest AI technologies
on low-power devices.
