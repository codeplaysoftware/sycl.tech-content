Wind River®, a global leader in delivering software to the intelligent edge, today announced the latest release of its
industry-leading real-time operating system (RTOS) VxWorks®, which has been enabling the security, safety, and
deterministic performance of embedded applications for more than 30 years. Over these three-plus decades, VxWorks has
continually evolved to meet the changing needs of software developers. The latest release redefines embedded software
development with new capabilities and industry firsts to drive greater business value, innovation, and productivity.

“This release of VxWorks will enable developers of next generation ADAS systems to integrate the most advanced vision
and machine learning solutions using OpenCL and SYCL, the Khronos open standards programming frameworks.” said Charles
Macfarlane, vice president of marketing, Codeplay Software. “Wind River has already achieved great results using our
ComputeAorta and ComputeCpp products, and together we continue to build an excellent ecosystem for automotive 
application development.”
