The CRTP idiom offers an alternative approach to polymorphism by providing us with the ability to specify static
interfaces, where the base class specifies the structure of the interface, while the derived one represents the
implementation. In this case, the base class does represent the interface and the derived class represents the
implementation â€” similar to the general idea of polymorphism.
