While traditionally high performance computing has seen use of interfaces such as FORTRAN, in the past few years there
has been a rapidly growing interest in using C++ for HPC applications. In fact, this year at SC19 there are many
sessions talking about C++, and more specifically SYCL, with a range of sessions presenting research projects using
SYCL, providing a forum for discussion and explaining how to develop using SYCL.
