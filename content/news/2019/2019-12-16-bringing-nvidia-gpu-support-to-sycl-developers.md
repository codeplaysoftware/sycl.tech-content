"We are excited to announce that in 2020 we will be releasing a project that brings full support for Nvidia devices to
SYCL developers. This project will be fully open source and initially includes integration with Intel's oneAPI, however
it could be integrated with other SYCL implementations. During this project our engineers have been working in
conjunction with Intel's engineers to implement a back-end for SYCL that uses CUDA to dispatch kernels in PTX
format enabling parallel execution on Nvidia GPUs."
