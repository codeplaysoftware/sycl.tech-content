The SYCL standard from the Khronos Group is a strong candidate for the implementation of this upcoming C++ standard. One
of the key concepts of SYCL is that the language used must be standard C++, with no extensions or added directives,
excepting only those C++ features that cannot be executed on an OpenCL deviceâ€”usually because of parallel hardware
limitations. The SYCL standard can run on any accelerator system that supports OpenCL 1.2 and above.
