In the latest White Paper from the Linley Group, Linley Gwennap examines how an open software ecosystem is critical to
enable developers to write artificial intelligence software that takes full advantage of the latest processors.

Gwennap says "Customers need more than just fast hardware; they need to run many different types of networks.
Furthermore, customers want to evolve their algorithms and even create new types of models in the future."

"Nvidia's software stack, based on its proprietary CUDA, creates a high barrier to entry for challengers. SYCL, the only
open alternative to CUDA that has multivendor support, enables customers to move to higher performance hardware while
retaining software flexibility. A commercial version of SYCL, branded ComputeCpp, is offered by Codeplay."
