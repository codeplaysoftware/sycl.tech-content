One API contains a new direct programming language, Data Parallel C++ (DPC++), an open, cross-industry alternative to
single architecture proprietary languages. DPC++ delivers parallel programming productivity and performance using a
programming model familiar to developers. DPC++ is based on C++, incorporates SYCL from the Khronos Group and includes
language extensions developed in an open community process.
