Moving towards their oneAPI beta release next quarter, the Intel developers are as busy as ever advancing their
LLVM-based SYCL compiler and run-times for Windows and Linux.

Out this morning is the SYCL Compiler and Runtimes 2019-09 release for this compiler to allow OpenCL offloading to
accelerators like Intel GPUs and FPGAs. New to this release are supporting some CL/SYCL FPGA extensions, support for
dumping the SYCL task graph to JSON, a long list of other SYCL/OpenCL improvements, and a wide range of bug fixes.
