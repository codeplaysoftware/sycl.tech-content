We are proud to be able to announce the availability of a set of open source learning materials for SYCLâ„¢, called "SYCL
Academy." These materials have been developed by engineers at Codeplay and have been delivered during training sessions
at events like CppCon and IWOCL. We are sharing them with the world to enable educators to teach and individuals to
learn all about SYCL.
