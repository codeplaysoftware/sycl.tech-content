One API looks to direct programming and API programming and, in the words of an Intel blog confirming the news, will
‘deliver a unified language and libraries that offer full native code performance across a range of hardware, including
CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators.’

Steven Leibson, senior content manager at Intel, added more meat to the bone in a further blog post. “DPC++ delivers
parallel programming productivity and performance using a programming model that’s already familiar to many developers,”
he wrote. “It’s based on C++ and incorporates the Khronos Group’s SYCL, which supports single source, heterogeneous
programming for OpenCL. Key machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow increasingly support SYCL due to its open
nature.
