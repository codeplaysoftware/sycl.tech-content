Opened up at the end of March is the work-in-progress Intel oneAPI back-end for Blender's Cycles renderer. This Intel
GPU back-end focused for supporting the company's forthcoming Intel Arc graphics cards is targeting the open-source
oneAPI Base Toolkit and making use of SYCL.

There still is more code work needed, but it's good to see this coming together to complement Blender's NVIDIA CUDA and
AMD HIP support.
