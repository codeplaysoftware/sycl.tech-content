Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the current COVID-19 situation and worldwide travel precautions, IWOCL and
SYCLcon is prioritizing the health and safety of the global OpenCL and SYCL community and will now proceed as a *
*virtual-only event**. This year we expect add to the number of live sessions we host during the event, as well as the
usual “can’t miss” scheduled and on-demand sessions. We have also taken this opportunity to move the event into May, and
have extended the [call for submissions](https://www.iwocl.org/call-for-submissions) deadline to: **Friday February 25, 2022**
