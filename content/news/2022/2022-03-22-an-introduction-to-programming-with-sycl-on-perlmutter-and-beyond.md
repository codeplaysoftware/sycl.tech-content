SYCL is an open standard programming model that allows developers to use standard C++ code to program for a range of
GPUs and other accelerator processors. This means that it is possible to develop using modern C++ code and target
Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs from a single code base. To enable SYCL on the latest supercomputers, Codeplay has been
working in partnership with different National Laboratories to bring SYCL support to Perlmutter, Polaris and Frontier.

Watch the half day hands-on workshop that walks through the fundamentals of SYCL programming using practical examples
and exercises to help reinforce the learning. Attendees will also learn how to compile their SYCL code using the DPC++
compiler to target Nvidia GPUs including those on the Perlmutter supercomputer. Lastly, weâ€™ll talk about some of the
things you need to know to achieve good performance, including best practices for memory management, with free time for
questions and discussions.
