SYCLomatic aims to ease the transition of NVIDIA CUDA code-bases over to C++17-based SYCL as the Khronos API single
source standard. This joins the likes of AMD's hipSYCL and other projects over the years working to support SYCL
integration with their compute stacks. The hope on Intel's side is to make CUDA code-bases more portable for running
across Intel CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other XPUs.
