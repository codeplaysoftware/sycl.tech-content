A walkthrough of converting a code from parallel C++ ray-tracing code to CUDA, and the work needed to make that CUDA
code run on CPU using parallel `for_each()` and then converted the code to SYCL 2020.

In this article, we will port [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/), the already converted parallel
code to CUDA, make CUDA run on CPU and then port again to SYCL 2020
via [IntelÂ® Data-Parallel C++ (DPC++)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/data-parallel-c-plus-plus.html)
toolkit. DPC++ is ISO C++ plus Khronos SYCL with community extensions eventually making their way into the final
standard. As time of article writing, the SYCL 2020 specification has been released for public review as a provisional
specification for developers to provide their valuable feedback before the final version is published and ratified.
