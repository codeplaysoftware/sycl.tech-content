“To prepare for Aurora, the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool allowed us to quickly migrate over 20 kernels to SYCL,”
Esteban Rangel, a computer scientist at Argonne, explains. “Since the current version of the code migration tool does
not support migration to functors, we wrote a simple clang tool to refactor the resulting SYCL source code to meet our
needs. With the open-source SYCLomatic project, we plan to integrate our previous work for a more robust solution and
contribute to making functors part of the available migration options.”
