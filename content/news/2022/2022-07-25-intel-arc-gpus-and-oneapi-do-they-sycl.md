oneAPI, featuring C++ with SYCL, enables the same accelerator code to run on a variety of GPU and CPU architectures. As
promised in
my [last post](https://betterprogramming.pub/cuda-sycl-codeplay-and-oneapi-accelerators-for-everyone-4603fee0421) about
heterogeneous computing, this time we are going to use the new Intel® Arc™ GPU and oneAPI to see how SYCL plays with
Intel Arc.
