SYCL 2020 is an exciting update for C++ programmers looking to take advantage of accelerators. We have both had the
pleasure of contributing to the SYCL specification,
a [book on SYCL](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5574-2), and
the [DPC++ open source project](https://intel.github.io/llvm-docs/GetStartedGuide.html) to implement SYCL into LLVM. We
would like to share our pick for our favorite new features added to SYCL in
the [SYCL 2020](http://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/) specification. We offer these as our opinions as Intel engineers,
not on behalf of Khronos.
