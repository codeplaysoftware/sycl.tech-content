Vincent is a physicist turned Computational Scientist and is working in conjunction with researchers at CERN who run
experiments with the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). As a
physicist he is of course very interested in the results from these experiments. His work focuses on the ATLAS detector,
one of the general purpose experiments stationed along the LHC ring, that is designed for particle physics research and
it is hoped will make physics discoveries beyond the Standard Model like supersymmetry (SUSY), graviton or Dark Matter.
The LHC has been built to facilitate experiments and research for at least a decade to come, so software written to run
and simulate research must be maintained for more than 10 years.

Hear the latest SYCL news, projects and research, and watch Vincent's presentation and conversation about his work.
