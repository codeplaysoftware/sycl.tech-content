As hardware advances and diversifies, weâ€™re entering what many see as a new golden age of computer architecture.
However, the idea of an ever-expanding [hardware](https://devops.com/?s=hardware) landscape can be daunting for software
developers, because while hardware diversity is wonderful for price and innovation, it can lead to spiraling software
complexity on the back end. So many software tools are specific to the hardware they run on that a world where CPUs,
GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, DSPs and more are freely intermingled feels overwhelming; an invitation to interoperability
headaches and spiraling tech overhead.

The question on the minds of developers is how to navigate this constantly changing ecosystem to take advantage of the
new world of hardware acceleration without driving themselves crazy in the process.
