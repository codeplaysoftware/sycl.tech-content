This release provides plugins for the Intel® DPC++/C++ Compiler using the oneAPI Toolkits to enable Nvidia and AMD GPU
platform targets. Although support for Nvidia and AMD GPUs has been available in the DPC++ open-source repository for a
while now, this is the first official binary release. Together with this release, Codeplay is providing a commercial
“Priority Support” package for customers who want quick answers to technical problems and general support for their
oneAPI deployment on Nvidia platforms directly with our team.
