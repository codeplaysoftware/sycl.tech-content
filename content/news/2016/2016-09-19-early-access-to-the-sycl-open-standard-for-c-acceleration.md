At Codeplay, we believe that the full performance of today's highly parallel devices should not be locked down to one
platform, but be available to all programmers by using open standards. That is why we are giving developers free, early
access to ComputeCpp™, our implementation of the SYCL™ open standard. The SYCL specification from the Khronos™ Group is
for developers who want to take software written using C++ single-source programming models like CUDA® or C++AMP and
port to a wide range of OpenCL™ devices.
