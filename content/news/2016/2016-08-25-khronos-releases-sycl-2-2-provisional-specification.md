April 18th 2016 – International Workshop on OpenCL, Vienna – The Khronos™ Group, an open consortium of leading hardware
and software companies, announces the immediate availability of the OpenCL™ 2.2, SYCL™ 2.2 and SPIR-V™ 1.1 provisional
specifications. OpenCL 2.2 incorporates the OpenCL C++ kernel language for significantly enhanced parallel programming
productivity. SYCL 2.2 enables host and device code to be contained in a single source file, while leveraging the full
power of OpenCL C++. SPIR-V 1.1 extends the intermediate representation defined by Khronos with native support for
shader and compute kernel features to fully support the OpenCL C++ kernel language. These new specifications can be
found at www.khronos.org and are released in provisional form to enable developers and implementers to provide feedback
before finalization, including at the Khronos forums.
