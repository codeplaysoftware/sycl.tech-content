Codeplay Software today announced ComputeCpp, an easy-to-use standards-based product for lowering the power consumption
and increasing the performance of C++ software. The first commercial release of ComputeCpp will support SYCL™ for
OpenCL™, the open-standard C++ programming model from The Khronos Group. SYCL allows C++ application developers to write
high-performance modern C++ and deploy it to multiple processor cores without hardware-specific rewrites or
optimizations.
