This page is to give a brief introduction of a Hello World for VisionCpp. VisionCpp is a high-level computer vision
framework that supports the development of performance portable computer vision applications running on
OpenCL-accelerated platforms. Taking advantage of SYCL's "single-source programming style", VisionCpp allows programmers
to easily develop custom vision operations in C++ and maintain type safety across host CPU and accelerator. The
generated application will then be portable to different platforms with no modification to the source code and with good
performance.
