"Last year we were really excited to learn that Intel is putting a huge effort behind SYCL and has been developing
oneAPI that includes DPC++ (an implementation of SYCL with extensions) for its CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. With the additional
support for SYCL from Xilinx, Renesas and Imagination Technologies, software developers are now able to target a wide
range of devices using SYCL.

While ComputeCpp offers experimental support for NVIDIA® GPUs using OpenCL™ and NVIDIA's PTX, DPC++ (Intel®'s SYCL
implementation) offered the opportunity to add full support for NVIDIA GPUs integrated into the LLVM compiler without
going through OpenCL, and today we are pleased to open source the initial, experimental phase of our implementation that
enables SYCL developers to target NVIDIA GPUs."
