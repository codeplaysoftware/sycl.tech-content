There is a momentum of movement towards SYCL, a KhronosÂ® open-standard alternative, providing many of the standard C++
programming needs of scientists and other programmers. Companies like Codeplay have, in effect, reset the playing field.
By clearly leading the definition of standards, companies can now use the same standard programming model with
non-Nvidia processors, as well as Nvidia GPUs. This sets a new high-water mark for standardized heterogeneous computing,
ideal for enterprises that employ accelerated processors. The goal is to leverage the open standard, which has long been
a requirement of high-performance computing as their workload can last 20 years while their hardware can change every
five years.
