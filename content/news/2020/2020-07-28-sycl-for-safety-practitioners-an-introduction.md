"There are many resources across the internet on functional safety in software, covering a substantial range of topics.
What I recognized is that there are no resources for safety practitioners and programmers looking at developing
applications with SYCLâ„¢ that are required to meet functional safety requirements. This is the first in a series of blog
posts that will give readers an overview of what they need to know about using SYCL in a safety-critical environment.
The information is most relevant to safety practitioners working with SYCL, but equally will help to educate developers
working on low-level drivers for DSPs and other processors."
