**Calling all C++, DPC++ and CUDA developers:** You write awesome code, but does your code take full advantage of all
the CPUs, GPUs, FPGA and other accelerators you have? This challenge will focus on **fast, efficient future-ready
cross-architecture development using SYCL with Data Parallel C++(DPC++)**.

No more being tied to proprietary languages that limit your ability to innovate on new hardware.

CodeProject.com, through sponsorship from Intel, is offering **over $40,000 in prizes** for the **oneAPI Cross
Architecture challenge** as well as once in a lifetime opportunities like CERN openlab Internship and a chance to work
on a project with Argonne National Laboratory.
