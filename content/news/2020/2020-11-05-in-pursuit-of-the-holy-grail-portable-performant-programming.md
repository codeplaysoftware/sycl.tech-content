Dr. Tom Deakin, senior research associate and lecturer in the High-Performance Computing Research Group at the
University of Bristol, and Dr. James Brodman, software engineer at Intel, unpack the tricky topic of performance
portability to reveal what this concept truly means and ways to achieve it. As contributors to the Khronos SYCL Working
Group—from the user and implementer perspectives—they talk about the exciting growth of the SYCL community, marked, in
part, by its implementations that now support a variety of hardware architectures, including DPC++ and hipSYCL.
