"In the latest episode of CppCast Codeplay VP of Research & Development Michael Wong talks about the provisional
specification of SYCL 2020. The specification has now been released and Michael joined Rob and Jason to give an
introduction to what SYCL is, and why the latest revision brings some great new features, as well as less verbose,
simpler code."
