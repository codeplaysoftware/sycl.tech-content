While Intel has been providing daily snapshots of the oneAPI Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) open-source compiler, today marks
the latest monthly feature compiler release to their cross-architecture language for direct programming that is based on
C++ while leveraging SYCL, LLVM/Clang, and other open-source technologies for exploiting the potential of hardware from
CPUs to GPUs and FPGAs.
