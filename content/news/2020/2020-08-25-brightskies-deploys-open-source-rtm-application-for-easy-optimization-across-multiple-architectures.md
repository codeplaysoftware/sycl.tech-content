At Brightskies, headquartered in Alexandria, Egypt, engineering teams are focused on code optimization and cloud
management for HPC applications in the oil and gas industry. Brightskies has partnered with multiple oil and gas
companies and research institutions to optimize code and evolve how these companies model and use seismic data.

RTM is a two-way, wave equation depth migration containing multiple patterns, which can put significant strain on all
computational resources, including compute, memory bandwidth, and I/O. To optimize processing on heterogeneous hardware
without creating problems with vendor lock-in, Brightskies chose to implement RTM using Data Parallel C++ (DPC++).
