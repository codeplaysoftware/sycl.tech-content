Bringing Standardized APIs Across Multiple Math Domains Using SYCL and the oneAPI Math Kernel Library.

The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) provide key functionality across CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators for
high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Historically, developers needed to write code for each hardware
platform. And there was no easy way to port source code from one accelerator to another.
