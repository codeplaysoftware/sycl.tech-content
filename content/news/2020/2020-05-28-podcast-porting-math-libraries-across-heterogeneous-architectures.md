"Codeplay Principal Software Engineer Mehdi Goli joined the Code Together podcast for a show about his work on porting
the oneMKL math kernel library to run on Nvidia GPUs using SYCL and DPC++.

Mehdi gave a bit of background on his experience in implementing math libraries. He talks about how important it is to
have a wide set of libraries available to developers and how this fosters a healthy developer community. "
