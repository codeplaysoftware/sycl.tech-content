"There is a momentum of movement towards SYCL, a KhronosÂ® open-standard alternative, providing many of the standard C++
programming needs of scientists and other programmers.

Companies can now use the same standard programming model with non-Nvidia processors, as well as Nvidia GPUs. This sets
a new high-water mark for standardized heterogeneous computing, ideal for enterprises that employ accelerated
processors. The goal is to leverage the open standard, which has long been a requirement of high-performance computing
as their workload can last 20 years while their hardware can change every five years. The industry as a whole needed to
return to an open standard programming model and bring HPC back to an open platform."
