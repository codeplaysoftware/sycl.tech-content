Members of the team at Codeplay have been working to evolve the Khronos open standard SYCL for the past 7 years, and
itâ€™s exciting for the community to be able to see SYCL 2020, the latest version of the standard.
In this blog engineers from Codeplay that are also contributors to the SYCL Working Group, the team that defines the
standard within Khronos, talk about what they think will make developing with SYCL even better when using SYCL 2020.
