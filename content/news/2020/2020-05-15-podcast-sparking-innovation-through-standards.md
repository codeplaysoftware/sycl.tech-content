Codeplay CEO Andrew Richards joined the Code Together podcast for a show entitled "Sparking Innovation through
Standards" and was joined by Geoff Lowney from Intel.

Andrew talked about his journey from writing computer games, to writing tools for computer games programmers, through to
creating frameworks using open standards that are being used by AI and HPC developers around the world.

"The only way you can get a software developers and hardware companies working together, the only way we can create a
vision where we say, actually you can write C++ and make it run very fast on lots of different platforms is by having
standards."
