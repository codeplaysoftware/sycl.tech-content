"Codeplay looks forward to IWOCL every year since the conference is laser focused on two of our favorite topics - OpenCL
and SYCL. This year we're particularly excited to be part of the first co-hosted IWOCL and SYCLcon, with SYCL bringing a
full track of presentations to the event.

As at every IWOCL conference, Codeplay is involved in a variety of activities. This year we will be represented in one
tutorial, four presentations, and two panel sessions."
