This is an introduction to the 
[Data Parallel C++](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html)
programming model, or DPC++ for short. DPC++ is based on Khronos SYCL, which means itâ€™s a modern C++ parallel
programming model. SYCL 1.2.1 is the latest Khronos standard, although the SYCL 2020 provisional specific is available
for review. Intel and other members of the SYCL working group are finalizing the next version of the language
specification. DPC++ contains extensions that make SYCL easier to use, although many of these are expected to be part of
SYCL 2020. Implementing extensions in the DPC++ compiler helps the community evaluate their effectiveness before
standardization.
