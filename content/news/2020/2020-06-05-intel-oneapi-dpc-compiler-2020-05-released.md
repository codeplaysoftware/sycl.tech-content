Intel has released oneAPI DPC++ Compiler 2020-05 as their latest snapshot for the current state of their LLVM-based Data
Parallel C++ Compiler.

Data Parallel C++ is Intel's cross-architecture language for direct programming that is derived from C++. DPC++
leverages Khronos' SYCL and the LLVM Clang compiler infrastructure so that the generated code in conjunction with the
DPC++ run-time can run on hardware from CPUs to GPUs, FPGAs, and other specialized accelerators.
