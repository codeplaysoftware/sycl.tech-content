SYCL is an open standard framework using standard ISO C++ with heterogeneous computing. SYCL 2020 is planned to be
released with updates suitable for HPC. and enabling multiple backends. SYCL through Intel’s OneAPI and DPC++ is adopted
to be the programming model for AURORA, the first CORAL exascale computer using Intel processors. Frontier and El
Capitan will be delivered with AMD processors. HipSYCL is suited to run on ROCM as one of our implementations. There is
also an Nvidia backend for some of our implementations suitable for Perlmutter.

After last three year’s (SC17, SC18, SC19) successful Heterogeneous & Distributed Computing in C++ for HPC BoF,
and SC19's SYCL BoF, there was popular demand for updates on these features added to SYCL 2020 and C++ 20. We have
integrated the C++ and SYCL BoF as many members attend both committees.

We will be answering audience questions using a bank of questions contributed in real-time by the audience and helping
audience members to understand how to experiment with SYCL and how to join the expanding SYCL community.

The session will begin with a presentation from the panel members followed by a live Q&A for 45 minutes.

Find out how to join this session through
