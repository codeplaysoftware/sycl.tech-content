The Khronos® Group, an open consortium of industry-leading companies creating graphics and compute interoperability
standards, announces the ratification and public release of the SYCL™ 2020 Provisional Specification. SYCL is a standard
C++ based heterogeneous parallel programming framework for accelerating High Performance Computing (HPC), machine
learning, embedded computing, and compute-intensive desktop applications on a wide range of processor architectures,
including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI processors.The SYCL 2020 Provisional Specification is publicly available today to
enable feedback from developers and implementers before the eventual specification finalization and release of the SYCL
2020 Adopters Program, which will enable implementers to be officially conformant—tentatively expected by the end of the
year.
