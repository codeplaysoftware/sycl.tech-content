In late February, the ALCF hosted its third Aurora hands-on workshop in the past year. Around 100 researchers
participating in the ALCF's Aurora Early Science Program (ESP) and DOE's Exascale Computing Project attended the
three-day workshop to advance their code and software development efforts for the Intel-Cray system.

Over the past year, Intel has unveiled new architectural details and tools that are helping researchers to accelerate
their preparatory work. Intel's initial oneAPI beta software toolkit aims to simplify application development across
diverse architectures
