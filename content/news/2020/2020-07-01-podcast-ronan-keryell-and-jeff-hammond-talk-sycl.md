Ronan Keryell, principal software engineer at Xilinx, and Jeff Hammond, principal engineer at Intel, explain why open
collaboration — modeled through open source and open standards — is key to solving some of today’s biggest challenges in
research and industry, revealing some of the misconceptions, or least understood aspects, along the way. Then they
explore the value of open languages and programming models, diving into ISO C++, Khronos Group SYCL, the amazing SYCL
community, and what excites them most about the SYCL 2020 Provisional Specification.
