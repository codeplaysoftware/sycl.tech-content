"The oneMKL BLAS library is the first math library implementation for oneAPI to enable support for NVIDIA GPUs and uses
the interoperability features implemented by DPC++. This work consists of a major open source contribution to the oneAPI
initiative by Codeplay. It also represents an opportunity for developers to use SYCL as an alternative to using CUDA for
developing high performance parallel applications."
