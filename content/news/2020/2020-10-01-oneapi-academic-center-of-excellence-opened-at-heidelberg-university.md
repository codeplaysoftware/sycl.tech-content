A oneAPI Academic Center of Excellence (CoE) is now established at
the [Heidelberg University Computing Center](https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en) (URZ). The CoE will conduct research
supporting the oneAPI industry initiative to create a uniform, open programming model for heterogeneous computer
architectures.

URZ’s work as a oneAPI CoE will add advanced DPC++ capabilities
into [hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL), which supports systems based on AMD GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and CPUs. New
DPC++ extensions are part of the SYCL 2020 provisional specification that brings features such as unified **shared**
memory **to hipSYCL** and the platforms it supports – furthering the promise of oneAPI application support across
system architectures and vendors.
