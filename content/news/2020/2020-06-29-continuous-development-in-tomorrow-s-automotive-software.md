"ADAS is constantly evolving, driven by legislation and improvements in both advanced vision algorithms and processing
hardware. By fully exploiting SYCL (a C++ open standard from The Khronos Group), which is familiar to any software
developer, developers can rapidly develop and maintain their applications without using special proprietary programming
languages, which are bespoke for hardware and impossible to maintain or evolve for decades."
