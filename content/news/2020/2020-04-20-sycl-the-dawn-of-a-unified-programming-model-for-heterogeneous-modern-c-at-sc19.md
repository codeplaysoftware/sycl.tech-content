"In this guest blog, Michael Wong, Chair of the SYCL Working Group and Vice President of Research and Development at
Codeplay Software Ltd, reflects on the evolution of SYCL in the past two years.

Personally, I have been dreaming of something like SYCL and oneAPI since I was involved with OpenMP. Even back then, I
had wished for one unified programming model that could be used to serve both the HPC and the embedded industries. SYCL
helps satisfy that goal, and Intelâ€™s unveiling of oneAPI showed an intention to use SYCL to support many types of
devices, from CPU to GPU to FPGA to dedicated AI processors."
