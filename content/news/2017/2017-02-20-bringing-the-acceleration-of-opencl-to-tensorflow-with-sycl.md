TensorFlow™ is an artificial intelligence framework that can be used for executing machine learning algorithms. While a
computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed across heterogeneous systems, support has so far been limited to
NVIDIA® processors using CUDA® . In order to enable developers to access a wider range of processors, we are working
to bring support for OpenCL™ devices to the TensorFlow framework using SYCL™. - See more
