In this post we will present a utility that facilitates integrating SYCL into existing codebases that are not C++11
friendly. If your application uses malloc and frees for allocation, or has some existing CUDAÂ®-based memory management,
the "Legacy Pointer" and/or the "Managed Virtual Pointer" utilities can help you to integrate your code with SYCL.
