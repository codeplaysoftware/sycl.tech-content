Leveraging the power of graphics cards for compute applications is all the rage right now in fields such as machine
learning, computer vision and high-performance computing. Technologies like OpenCL expose this power through a
hardware-independent programming model, allowing you to write code which abstracts over different architecture
capabilities.
