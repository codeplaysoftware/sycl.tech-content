In this webinar we demonstrate how an existing CUDA stencil application code can be migrated to DPC++ with the help of
the Compatibility Tool. We highlight and discuss the crucial differences between the two programming environments in the
context of migrating the tsunami simulation easyWave. The discussion also includes steps for making the code to
compliant with the SYCL standard. During the talk, we also show that the migrated code can run on a wide range of
platforms starting from CPUs, over GPUs, to FPGAs.
