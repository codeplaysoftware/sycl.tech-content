This talk will present the current state of the SYCL ecosystem, including the supported implementations of which now
there are four; ComputeCpp, DPC++, hipSYCL and triSYCL, as well as the range of platforms that are now supported by SYCL
via these implementations. It will take a close look specifically at supporting Nvidia GPUs via DPC++â€™s CUDA backend, as
this was a widely requested feature by SYCL developers in the C++ community.

This talk will then take a deep dive into the new features that SYCL 2020 is introducing and how these will improve SYCL
application development for C++ developers.

Finally, this talk will end with a look at the SYCL standard, and where we hope to see it going in the future.
