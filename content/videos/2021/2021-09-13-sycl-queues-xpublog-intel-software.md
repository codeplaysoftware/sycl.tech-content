What can you tell me about SYCL queues? Queues are the fundamental connection between a host and a device (XPU) when
programming using SYCL. Three operations are available via queues to assign work to an XPU, and three more operations
deal with memory operations for sharing data with an XPU. While simple enough to learn, there are a number of questions
that can arise which are answered in the “rest of the story” segment of this video. This video is an installment in
James Reinders' XPU blog series that takes a look at various aspects of XPU programming to accomplish heterogeneous
programming.
