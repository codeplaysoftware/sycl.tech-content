Erik Lindahl, biophysics professor leading GROMACS research and its transition to oneAPI shares the value of the open
standards-based, cross-architecture, cross-vendor programming model. GROMACS, a molecular dynamics package designed for
simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids used to design new drugs, is optimized using oneAPI together with
SYCL to ensure it can parallelize better and utilize the power of multiple types of architectures. GROMACS is “an
amazing molecular microscope and a very advanced tool… where maybe 4% or 5% of all the supercomputing time in the world
that is spent on GROMACS,” says Lindahl. He adds, “So the part of oneAPI that is most important to me and my team is of
course that it's an open standard. We are firm believers in open standards.. because that means that we can rely on it
no matter what the vendors do.
