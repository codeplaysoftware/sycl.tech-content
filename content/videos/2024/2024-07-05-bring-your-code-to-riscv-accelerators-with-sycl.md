This talk will show attendees how to overcome proprietary code with RISC-V and SYCL. They will learn how they can
achieve code portability and adopt RISC-V hardware without losing their existing work, for greater productivity.

The talk will also highlight the ongoing research into pioneering applications for RISC-V, funded by the EU Horizon
programme. AERO and SYCLOPS are two such projects. AERO seeks to enable the future heterogeneous EU cloud
infrastructure, while SYCLOPS will bring together the RISC-V and SYCL standards together into a single software stack
for the first time.
