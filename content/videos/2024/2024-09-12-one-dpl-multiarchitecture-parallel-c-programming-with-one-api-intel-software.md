The Intel® Developer Zone encourages and supports software developers developing applications for Intel hardware and
software products. The Intel Software YouTube channel is a place to learn tips and tricks, get the latest news, and
watch product demos from Intel and our many partners across multiple fields. You'll find videos covering the topics
listed below, and to learn more, you can follow the links provided!

oneDPL, a part of the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit, is a flexible and optimized library for adding cross-platform
parallelism to your C++ applications for accelerated heterogeneous computing across the latest hardware from diverse
vendors. It lets you leverage the parallel programming capabilities of the SYCL framework, enhancing the performance of
C++ workloads. Its latest feature also grants developers a freedom to choose from the available compute resources for
executing their workloads, based on some pre-defined device selection policies provided by the library.

With oneDPL, you can achieve remarkable performance improvements and acceleration in complex computations in real-world
applications such as financial modeling, scientific projects, real-time systems, web and cloud-based services, and much
more.

This video will give you an overview of oneDPL and its component APIs and how C++ developers can benefit from the
multiarchitecture, vendor-independent, accelerated parallel computing capabilities that the library adds to their C++
applications.
