Building autonomous vehicles: How do we build the software and platforms that enable the intelligence for self-driving
cars and all the intermediate levels of autonomy? We don't (yet) know the right algorithms or approach, so how do we
start developing the software in a way that can deliver the safety, performance, power consumption and correctness to
enable ADAS to full autonomy?
