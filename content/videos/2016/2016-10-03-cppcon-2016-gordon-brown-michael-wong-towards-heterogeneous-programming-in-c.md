The new world of heterogeneous systems brings with it many new challenges for the C++ community and for the language
itself, and if these were to be overcome then C++ would have the potential to standardize the future of heterogeneous
programming. In fact this work has already begun in SG14 in form of a mandate to support massive parallel dispatch for
heterogeneous devices in the C++ standard using recent models such as SYCL and HPX. A recent approach to solving these
challenges comes in the form of SYCL, a shared-source C++ programming model for OpenCL. SYCL takes a very different
approach from many before it, in that it is specifically designed to be standard C++ without any extensions to the
language.
