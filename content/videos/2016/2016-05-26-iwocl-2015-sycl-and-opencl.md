SYCL is a royalty-free, cross-platform C++ abstraction layer that builds on the underlying concepts, portability and
efficiency of OpenCL, while adding the ease-of-use and flexibility of modern C++11. For example, SYCL enables single
source development where C++ template functions can contain both host and device code to construct complex algorithms
that use OpenCL acceleration, and then re-use them throughout their source code on different types of data.
