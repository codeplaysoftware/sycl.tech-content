Recent initiatives attempt to bring modern C++ applications to heterogeneous devices. The Khronos Group published SYCL
in mid-2015. SYCL offers a single-source C++ programming environment built on top of OpenCL. Codeplay and the University
of Bath are currently collaborating on a C++ front-end for HSAIL (HSA Intermediate Language) from the HSA Foundation.
Both models use a similar single-source C++ approach, in which the host and device kernel C++ code is interleaved. A
kernel always starts using specific function calls, which take a functor object. To support the compilation of these two
high-level programming models, Codeplay's compilers rely on a common engine based on Clang and LLVM to extract and
manipulate those kernels.
