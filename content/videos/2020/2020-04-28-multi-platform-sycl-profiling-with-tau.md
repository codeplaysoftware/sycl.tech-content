A major challenge in high-performance computing is performance portability. Using abstraction layers like SYCL,
applications can be developed which can target, with the same code base, different execution environments, such as
traditional CPUs, many-core accelerators, and GPUs of various architectures, such as those from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.
However, cross-platform code produced in that way will not necessarily provide acceptable performance on multiple
platforms. Performance analysis tools are needed to evaluate performance of SYCL applications.
