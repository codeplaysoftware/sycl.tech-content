This talk will describe several extensions that DPC++ has proposed and implemented on top of SYCL. While many of the
extensions can help to improve application performance, all of them work to improve programmer productivity by both
enabling easy integration into existing C++ applications, and by simplifying common patterns found in SYCL and C++.
DPC++ is a proving ground where the value of extensions can be demonstrated before being proposed for inclusion in
future versions of the SYCL specification. Intel contributes DPC++ extensions back to SYCL, to enable a unified
standards-based solution.
