Future HPC leadership computing systems for the United States Department of Energy will utilize GPUs for acceleration of
scien- tific codes. These systems will utilize GPUs from various vendors which places a large focus on the performance
portability of the programming models used by scientific application developers. In the HPC domain, SYCL is an open C++
standard for heterogeneous computing that is gaining support. This is fueling a growing inter-est in understanding the
performance of SYCL toolchains for the various GPU vendors.
