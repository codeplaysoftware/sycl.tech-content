In this presentation we will look at oneVPL (oneAPI Video Processing Library) and how it is used in Certiface technology
designed to combat fraud and protect honest people by ability to differentiate between a live person and a recorded
video. Certiface is based to harness heterogeneous computing architecture including CPUs and GPUs from servers to
notebooks. The software tools such as oneVPL, computer vision techniques with openCV, openVINO and Deep Learning
technologies based on Intel features such as TBB, IPP and MKL, and high-performance computing. This technology processes
millions of faces per second in the cloud, making banking transaction operations in Brazil secure, fast and effective.
