In the first quarter of 2020 the SYCL™ working group of the Khronos® Group will seek to ratify a new provisional
revision of the SYCL specification. This new revision will bring a number of significant improvements that will improve
the portability and capabilities of the standard that will continue the goal of the SYCL programming model to provide a
modern C++ programming model that is portable across the widest range of hardware.
