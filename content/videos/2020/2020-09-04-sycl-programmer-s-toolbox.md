To many, programming highly parallel architectures still seems like a daunting task, as low-level APIs and limited
tooling support have historically resulted in a developer experience that leaves much to be desired. However, great
strides have been made in recent years, with modern programming models such as SYCL alleviating most of these pains. In
particular, SYCL developers may benefit from its modern API design, flexible execution model as well as robust tooling
support for underlying hardware platforms â€“ if they know how to take advantage of it. This talk, aimed at beginners and
intermediate SYCL users, will take a look at a variety of useful tips, tricks and techniques that may come in handy
during SYCL application development.
