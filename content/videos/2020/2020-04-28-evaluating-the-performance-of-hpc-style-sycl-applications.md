SYCL is a parallel programming model for developing single-source programs for running on heterogeneous platforms. To
this end, it allows for one code to be written which can run on a different architectures. For this study, we develop
applications in SYCL which are representative of those often used in High-Performance Computing. Their performance is
benchmarked on a variety of CPU and GPU architectures from multiple vendors, and compared to well optimised versions
written in OpenCL and other parallel programming models.
