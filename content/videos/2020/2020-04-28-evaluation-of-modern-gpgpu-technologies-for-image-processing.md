In the course of being able to provide guidance on selecting the right API in an image processing context, four GPU
programming models were compared according to their platform independence, usability, and performance. To gain
information on the metrics usability and performance a test project was created, implementing a number of image
processing tasks in the four GPU programming models. The reference algorithms form a pipeline for processing images from
polarization cameras. The four investigated APIs are CUDA, OpenCL 1.2, Vulkan and SYCL.
