Heterogeneous parallel programming with open standards using oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ by Jeff Hammond (Intel)

Diversity in computer architecture and the unceasing demand for application performance in data-intensive workloads are
never-ending challenges for programmers. This talk will describe Intelâ€™s oneAPI initiative, which is an open ecosystem
for heterogeneous computing that supports high-performance data analytics, machine learning and other workloads. A key
component of this is Data Parallel C++, which is based on C++17 and Khronos SYCL and supports direct programming of CPU,
GPU and FPGA platforms. We will describe how oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ can be used to build high-performance
applications for a range of devices.
