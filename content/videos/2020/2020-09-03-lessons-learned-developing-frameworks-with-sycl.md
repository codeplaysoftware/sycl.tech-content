alpaka is a header-only C++ library for developing portable high-performance programs. Much like SYCL, it aims to
abstract away the differences between accelerator types and vendors. In 2019 an experimental SYCL backend was developed
in order to target FPGAs. In my talk I will focus on the challenges I faced during the SYCL backend development as well
as conceptual differences between SYCL and other heterogeneous programming platforms.
