In order to make the most of various accelerators, a programming model is required to support portability without losing
performance. During this presentation, we will examine some of these projects. Show how these libraries can be used to
offer portability and performance, and how these libraries can be used to accelerate complex HPC applications. Codeplay
Software will discuss some of the available papers detailing the implementation, performance, and programmability of
these libraries and frameworks.
