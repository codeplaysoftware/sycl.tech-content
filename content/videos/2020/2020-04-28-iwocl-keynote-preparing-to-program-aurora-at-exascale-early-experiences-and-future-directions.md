Argonne National Laboratory’s Leadership Computing Facility will be home to Aurora, our first exascale supercomputer.
Aurora promises to take scientific computing to a whole new level, and scientists and engineers from many different
fields will take advantage of Aurora’s unprecedented computational capabilities to push the boundaries of human
knowledge. In addition, Aurora’s support for advanced machine-learning and big-data computations will enable scientific
workflows incorporating these techniques along with traditional HPC algorithms.
