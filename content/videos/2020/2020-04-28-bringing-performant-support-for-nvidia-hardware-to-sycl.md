This talk will describe how Codeplay™ has collaborated with Intel® to deliver an open source SYCL back-end
implementation for the Clang LLVM compiler project that provides full support for Nvidia GPUs. We will present details
of how the implementation has been designed and the current status of the implementation. This is an ongoing project
from Codeplay that will see further progress over the year, including support for more CUDA features, integration with
libraries and performance improvements.
