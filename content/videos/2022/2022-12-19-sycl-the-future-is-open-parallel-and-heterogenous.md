Presented by Guy Tamir and Yair Friedman at Core C++ 2022. oneAPI industry initiative is taking C++ to a heterogeneous
and parallel computing future with SYCL. SYCL takes programmers out of proprietary languages to an open-source
open-vendor cross device world. Understand the motivation and the vision behind SYCL, learn and see demos of the basics
of SYCL to get started. And hear success stories from companies, universities and national labs who are already using
SYCL.
