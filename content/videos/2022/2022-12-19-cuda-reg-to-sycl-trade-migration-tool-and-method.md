SYCL is becoming a de facto standard for vendor agnostic heterogeneous computing. Upgrading CUDA code to standard C++
with SYCL makes the applications portable across a range of existing and evolving accelerators including NVidia GPUs.
The "Migrating to SYCL" portal on Intel Developer Zone is designed to help the worldwide developer community
successfully port their applications to oneAPI, helping developers break free from propriety APIs and provide greater
customer choice in hardware for performance, power usage and cost.
