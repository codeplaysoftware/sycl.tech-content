There is a growing need for higher level abstractions for device kernels in heterogeneous environments, and the
multi-level nature of the MLIR infrastructure perfectly addresses this requirement. As SYCL begins to gain industry
adoption for heterogeneous applications and MLIR continues to develop, we present SYCLops: a converter capable of
translating SYCL specific LLVM IR to MLIR. This will allow for both target and application specific optimizations within
the same framework to exploit opportunities for improvement present at different levels.
