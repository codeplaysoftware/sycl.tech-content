This talk strives to untangle the landscape of modern parallel programming models, to help developers understand how the
models and options relate to each other, and to frame how to think about their specific algorithms when expressing them
in code. Although experienced developers typically understand much of the terminology and the relationships between
models, a holistic presentation of the material is of strong value, as evidenced by feedback from parallel programming
experts that have seen previews of this presentation.
