Codeplay and CoreAVI are leading a new Exploratory Forum within Khronos, to evaluate industry interest in a new Khronos
API based on SYCL, which is targeted towards the safety-critical industry, called SYCL SC (Safety Critical).

Safety-critical industries like avionics, automotive, nuclear and rail require their software to be compliant to safety
standards such as ISO 26262, DIS21448/SOTIF, DO-178C and UL4600, as well as adhering to guidelines defined by AUTOSAR
and MISRA. Historically, software written for safety-critical applications has been written in C or entirely generated
by modeling tools, but this is changing rapidly.

Software and hardware complexity is growing, and in particular the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
skyrocketed, for which higher levels of abstraction are required. Possibly the most high-profile example of using AI is
to enable the development of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles, which manufacturers are competing to be the first
to develop safely.
