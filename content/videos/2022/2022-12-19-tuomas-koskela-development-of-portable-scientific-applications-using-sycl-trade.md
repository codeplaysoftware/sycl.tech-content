High performance computing systems available right now, and those being built for the exascale make extensive use of
accelerators, mostly GPUs. Developing scientific software for future GPU systems is challenging, because GPU vendors
tend to try to lock users into their own programming models that typically are not portable across vendors. A programmer
starting on a new HPC project may struggle with the choice of a programming model that will guarantee portability to
future systems.
