CUDA has become the defacto standard for GPU compute in most fields. AI and Machine Learning via projects like
tensorflow are all targeting CUDA as their runtime. CUDA however as one major flaw, it's closed source and requires
closed source drivers. This talk will explore the current state of non-CUDA compute stacks, concentrating on the OpenCL,
SPIR-V and SYCL projects from Khronos, but also touching on Vulkan compute and other possibilities.
