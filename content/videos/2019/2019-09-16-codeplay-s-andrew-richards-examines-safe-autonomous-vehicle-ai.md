The need for ensuring safety in AI subsystems within autonomous vehicles is obvious. How to achieve it is not. Standard
safety engineering tools are designed for software that runs on general-purpose CPUs. But AI algorithms require more
performance than CPUs provide, and the specialized processors employed to achieve this performance are very difficult to
qualify for safety.
