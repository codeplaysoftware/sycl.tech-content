C++17 introduced parallel algorithms, but the current interface prevents heterogeneous systems -- such as personal
computers and server nodes with GPUs, smartphones, and embedded System on a Chip -- from taking advantage of parallel
computation. Through its clean, algorithmic composition, we believe that the Ranges TS and its proposed extensions offer
solutions to these problems, and how well programs perform on heterogeneous platforms. We will discuss why adopting
Ranges will be beneficial for your programs, and once parallelised, how they naturally lend themselves to parallelising
your code with minimal changes on your part.
