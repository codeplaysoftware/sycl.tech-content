So why is the world rushing to add Massive Parallelism to base languages when consortiums and companies have been trying
to fill that space for years? How is the landscape of Heterogeneous Parallelism changing in the various standards, and
specifications? How will todayâ€™s programming models address the needs of future Internet of Things, self-driving cars
and Machine Learning. I will give an overview as well as a deep dive into what C, C++ is doing to add parallelism, but
also how consortiums like Khronos OpenCL/SYCL is pushing forward into the High-level Modern C++ Language support for
GPU/Accelerators and SIMD programming. And ultimately, how these will converge into the future C++ Standard through
future C++20 proposals such as executors, and affinity from my capacity of leading many of these efforts as chair of
Wg2`s SG14.
