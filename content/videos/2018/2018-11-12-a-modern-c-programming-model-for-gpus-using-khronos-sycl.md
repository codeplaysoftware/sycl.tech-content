This talk will present the SYCL programming model. It will cover how to find an appropriate heterogeneous device to
execute work on, how to define data dependencies and construct task graphs using accessors and how to write C++ code
which will execute on the device. It will cover other features of the interface including the host device, the fallback
and templating device code. It will then present various ecosystem projects which are built on top of SYCL including
Eigen / TensorFlow, Parallel STL and SYCBLAS.
