VisionCpp allows computer vision application developers to write all of their code in C++ and have it aggressively
optimised at compile time through kernel fusion and expression templates. Codeplay's implementation of SYCL -
ComputeCpp - enables acceleration of the application on GPU devices, giving you both expressibility in the source code
and real-time performance
