As performance and power-efficiency become the holy grail of modern C++ applications, the hardware solutions that
deliver them differ greatly in architecture decisions and designs. The combination of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and custom
domain specific hardware is gaining a lot of momentum. In view of this, C++ programming techniques and features are
changing as well. Modern C++ standards are enabling more and more parallelism and heterogeneity in the library and
language features.
