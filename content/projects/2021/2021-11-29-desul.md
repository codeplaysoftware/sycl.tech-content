The DESUL organization and project will contain open source common core components for DOE applications and libraries
with a focus on C++ development and standardization. This is intended to cover high performance computing system
software and development libraries and helpers as well as possibly fundamental computer science algorithms and basic
components and examples and/or proxy codes related to the other components. It is not intended to cover scientific
applications, or applications in general with the exception of development tools and scripts.
