CHIP-SPV is a HIP implementation that abstracts HIP API, providing a set of base classes that can be derived from to
implement an additional, SPIR-V capable backend on which to execute HIP calls. Currently CHIP-SPV OpenCL and Level Zero
as backends. This project is a result of HIPCL and HIPLZ projects.
