OCCA is an open source, portable, and vendor neutral framework for parallel programming on heterogeneous platforms. The
OCCA API provides unified models for heterogeneous programming concepts—such as a device, memory, or kernel—while the
OCCA Kernel Language (OKL) enables the creation of portable device kernels using a directive-based extension to the
C-language.
