SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'fink-sis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems.
The multi-physics library uses SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) as the underlying numerical method for both
particle-based and mesh-based discretization. Due to the unified computational framework, SPHinXsys is able to carry out
simulation and optimization at the same time.
