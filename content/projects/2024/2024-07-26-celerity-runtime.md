Programming modern accelerators is already challenging in and of itself. Combine it with the distributed memory
semantics of a cluster, and the complexity can become so daunting that many leave it unattempted. Celerity wants to
relieve you of some of this burden, allowing you to target accelerator clusters with programs that look like they are
written for a single device.
