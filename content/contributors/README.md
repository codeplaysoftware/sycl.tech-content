# Contributing Contributors

If you would like to create a contributor profile, please create a new file within this directory, name it using the
username you would like to use, replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with a `-`. For example, if your username 
is `john.smith', you should create a new file with the name `john-smith.md`.

Once you have created your file, copy and paste the contents below, replacing all the details with your own.

```markdown

Hello, my name is John Smith and this is my public profile!
```

You can add an avatar to the `../../../static/images/contributors/` directory. Name it the same as your username format
as above. `.webp` images are preferred but not essential. Keep the directory path relative.

Once you have done all the above, create a pull request to the repository.
