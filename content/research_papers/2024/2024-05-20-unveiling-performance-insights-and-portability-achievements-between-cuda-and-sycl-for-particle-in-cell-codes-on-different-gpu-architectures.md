The HPC systems worldwide are getting more powerful with the combination of CPU, GPU, and other accelerators (e.g.,
FPGAs and Quantum Processors). Many programming frameworks mainly offer excellent support portability to the existing
scientific codes to use the exascale HPC systems. This study evaluates the performance and portability of CUDA and SYCL
for one of the most used plasma kinetic simulation codes Particle-In-Cell (PIC). The PIC codes are numerical modelling
tools used for handling the extreme nonlinear methods in fusion devices. The experimental work showed that accelerating
the PIC code with CUDA and SYCL achieve similar performance on NVIDIA devices, the latter demonstrated remarkable code
portability to other GPU architectures. This brief study highlights the potential of SYCL as a viable solution for
achieving both performance and portability in the heterogeneous computing ecosystem.
