Motivated by maturing programming models and portability for heterogeneous computing, we describe the challenges posed
by hardware architectures and programming models when migrating an optimized implementation of nonuniform reduction from
CUDA to HIP and SYCL. We explain the migration experience, evaluate the performance of the reduction on GPU -based
computing platforms, and provide feedback on improving portability for the development of the SYCL programming model.
