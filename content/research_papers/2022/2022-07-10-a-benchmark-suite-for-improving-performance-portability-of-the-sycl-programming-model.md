SYCL is a portable programming model for multivendor computing devices. Portability is critical for its success. The
heterogeneous computing benchmark suite (HeCBench) is a collection of samples, benchmarks, and mini-applications from
many open-source projects for heterogeneous computing. We hope that HeCBench is useful for understanding and improving
performance portability in the development of the SYCL ecosystem. This abstract is a summary of the background, use
cases, improvement, and future work of the benchmark suite.
