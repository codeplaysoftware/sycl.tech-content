We describe our experiences in creating mini-apps for the Wilson-Dslash stencil operator for Lattice Quantum Chromo
dynamics using the Kokkos and SYCL programming models. In particular, we comment on the performance achieved on a
variety of hardware architectures, limitations we have reached in both programming models and how these have been
resolved by us, or may be resolved by the developers of these models.
