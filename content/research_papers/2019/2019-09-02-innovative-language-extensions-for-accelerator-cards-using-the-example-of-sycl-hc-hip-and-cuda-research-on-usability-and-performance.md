Translated from German: "The purpose of this work is a comparative analysis of the programming models CUDA, SYCL and
ROCm (or HC and HIP) on GPUs of the manufacturers NVIDIA and AMD. On the one hand, the skills and concepts underlying
the respective models are to be compared, on the other hand the concrete achievable performance is to be determined by
means of suitable benchmarks. The findings thus obtained are used to derive recommendations for the future use of these
models in the HPC environment."
