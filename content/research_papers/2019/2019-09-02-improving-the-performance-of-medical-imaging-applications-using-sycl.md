In this report, we are interested in applying the SYCL programming model to medical imaging applications for a study on
performance portability and programming productivity. The SYCL standard specifies a cross-platform abstraction layer
that enables programming of heterogeneous computing systems using standard C++. As opposed to the Open Computing
Language (OpenCL) programming model, in which host and device code are generally written in different programming
languages, SYCL can combine host and device code for an application in a type-safe way to improve development
productivity and performance portability.
